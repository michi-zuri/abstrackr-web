Both socioeconomic neighbourhood characteristics and factors of the built environment play an important role for health and health-related behaviours. However, their reciprocal relationships have not been systematically reviewed so far. This systematic review aims to identify studies applying a multilevel modelling approach which consider both neighbourhood socioeconomic position (SEP) and factors of the objective built environment simultaneously in order to disentangle their independent and interactive effects on individual health. METHODS: The three databases PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science were systematically searched with terms for title and abstract screening. Grey literature was not included. Observational studies from USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Western European countries were considered which analysed simultaneously factors of neighbourhood SEP and the objective built environment with a multilevel modelling approach. Adjustment for individual SEP was a further inclusion criterion. RESULTS: Thirty-three studies were included in qualitative synthesis. Twenty-two studies showed an independent association between characteristics of neighbourhood SEP or the built environment and individual health outcomes or health-related behaviours. Twenty-one studies found cross-level or within-level interactions either between neighbourhood SEP and the built environment, or between neighbourhood SEP or the built environment and individual characteristics, such as sex, individual SEP or ethnicity. Due to the large variation of study design and heterogeneous reporting of results the identification of consistent findings was problematic and made quantitative analysis not possible. CONCLUSIONS: There is a need for studies considering multiple neighbourhood dimensions and applying multilevel modelling in order to clarify their causal relationship towards individual health. Especially, more studies using comparable characteristics of neighbourhood SEP and the objective built environment and analysing interactive effects are necessary to disentangle health impacts and identify vulnerable neighbourhoods and population groups.','Schule SA and Bolte G','PloS one',NULL,'*Environment Design,Humans,*Models, Theoretical,Multilevel Analysis,*Public Health,*Residence Characteristics,*Social Networking,Socioeconomic Factors'),(17,2,'28109320','28109320','Celebrities\' impact on health-related knowledge, attitudes, behaviors, and status outcomes: protocol for a systematic review, meta-analysis, and meta-regression analysis.','BACKGROUND: Celebrities are highly influential people whose actions and decisions are watched and often emulated by wide audiences. Many celebrities have used their prominent social standing to offer medical advice or endorse health products, a trend that is expected to increase. However, the extent of the impact that celebrities have in shaping the public\'s health-related knowledge, attitudes, behaviors, and status is unclear. This systematic review seeks to answer the following questions: (1) Which health-related outcomes are influenced by celebrities? (2) How large of an impact do celebrities actually have on these health-related outcomes? (3) Under what circumstances do celebrities produce either beneficial or harmful impacts? METHODS: Ten databases were searched, including MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, PubMed, CINAHL, Communication Complete, Sociological Abstracts, Social Sciences Citation Index, Journals @ Scholars Portal, and ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I. Two reviewers conducted title and abstract screening and full-text screening to identify primary studies that employed empirical methods (either quantitative or qualitative) to examine celebrities\' impact on health-related knowledge, attitudes, behaviors, or status outcomes. DISCUSSION: The results of this review will contribute to our understanding of celebrity influences and how to design positive evidence-based celebrity health promotion activities. In addition, these findings can help inform the development of media reporting guidelines pertaining to celebrity health news and provide guidance to public health authorities on whether and how to respond to or work with celebrities.

However, efficacy and quality must be reliably established prior to widespread implementation. METHODS: A comprehensive search of databases, peer-reviewed journals, published reviews, and both published and unpublished documents yielded 10,077 distinct records. Title and abstract screening, followed by full-text screening using 6 criteria, resulted in 56 distinct studies (coalescing into 10 sport-based youth development intervention types) included in the synthesis. These studies were then independently assessed and critically appraised. RESULTS: Limited efficacy data were identified, with the quality of methods and evidence largely classified as weak. Processes likely to contribute to the outcomes of sport-based youth development interventions were identified (e.g., predictors of ongoing engagement, alignment between target population and intervention, intervention design), although more rigorous research is needed on these and other processes. Physical health outcomes were only studied in 3 of the 10 intervention types. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence base does not yet warrant wide-scale implementation of sport-based youth development interventions for public health goals within the U. S., although there is promising research that identifies areas for further exploration.','Whitley MA and Massey WV and Camire M and Boutet M and Borbee A','BMC public health',NULL,'Adolescent,*Adolescent Development,Child,*Child Development,Health Promotion/*methods,Humans,Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic,United States,*Youth Sports'),(19,2,'22025866','22025866','Zotero: A bibliographic assistant to researcher.',NULL,'Ahmed KK and Al Dhubaib BE','Journal of pharmacology & pharmacotherapeutics',NULL,''),(20,2,'31096439','31096439','Current perspectives on the opioid crisis in the US healthcare system: A comprehensive literature review.','INTRODUCTION: The administration of opioids has been used for centuries as a viable option for pain management. When administered at appropriate doses, opioids prove effective not only at eliminating pain but further preventing its recurrence in long-term recovery scenarios. Physicians have complied with the appropriate management of acute and chronic pain; however, this short or long-term opioid exposure provides opportunities for long-term opioid misuse and abuse, leading to addiction of patients who receive an opioid prescription and/or diversion of this pain medication to other people without prescription. Several reviews attempted to summarize the epidemiology and management of opioid misuse, this integrative review seeks to summarize the current literature related with responsible parties of this opioid abuse crisis and discuss potential associations between demographics (ethnicity, culture, gender, religion) and opioid accessibility, abuse and overdose. METHODS: We performed an extensive literature search in Google Scholar and Pub Med databases that were published between December 7, 1999 and January 9, 2018 in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. Searches were referenced using medical subject headings (MeSH) that included \"opioids\", \"over-prescription\", \"opioid consumption\", or \"opioid epidemic\". The final review of all data bases was conducted on July 24, 2018. RESULTS: A total of 7160 articles were originally identified. After 3340 duplicate articles were removed, 3820 manuscripts were removed after title and abstract screening. Following this, 120 manuscripts underwent eligibility selection with only 70 publications being selected as reliable full-texts addressing related factors surrounding the opioid crisis. CONCLUSION: With approximately 100 million people suffering from both chronic and acute pain in the United States (US) in 2016, opiates will continue to remain a prominent class of medication in healthcare facilities and homes across the US. Over 66% of total overdose episodes in 2016 were opioid-related, a figure that attests to the severity and wide-spread nature of this issue. A three-point approach accentuating the prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation of both those currently affected and at-risk in the future may be the comprehensive solution.','Stoicea N and Costa A and Periel L and Uribe A and Weaver T and Bergese SD','Medicine',NULL,'Acute Pain/drug therapy,Adolescent,Adult,Analgesics, Opioid/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/therapeutic use,Behavior, Addictive/chemically induced,Chronic Pain/drug therapy,Delivery of Health Care/*standards/statistics & numerical data,Drug Overdose/*epidemiology,Epidemics,Female,Humans,Inappropriate Prescribing/adverse effects/statistics & numerical data,Male,Middle Aged,Opioid-Related Disorders/*epidemiology,Pain Management/adverse effects/methods,United States/epidemiology,Young Adult'),(21,2,'31284092','31284092','PFAS health effects database: Protocol for a systematic evidence map.','BACKGROUND: Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) confer waterproof, greaseproof, and non-stick properties when added to consumer products. They are also used for industrial purposes including in aqueous film forming foams for firefighting. PFAS are ubiquitous in the environment, are widely detected in human biomonitoring studies, and are of growing regulatory concern across federal, state, and local governments. Regulators, scientists, and citizens need to stay informed on the growing health and toxicology literature related to PFAS. OBJECTIVES: The goal of this systematic evidence map is to identify and organize the available health and toxicology related literature on a set of 29 PFAS of emerging and growing concern. SEARCH AND STUDY ELIGIBILITY: We will search the electronic database PubMed for health or toxicological studies on 29 PFAS of emerging concern. Eligible studies must contain primary research investigating the link between one or more of the PFAS of interest and a health effect, toxicological, or biological mechanistic endpoint. STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS: Title and abstract screening and full text review will require a single reviewer for inclusion to the next level and two independent reviewers for exclusion. Study quality will not be conducted for this evidence mapping. Study characteristics will be extracted and coded from the included studies and checked for accuracy by a second reviewer. The extracted and coded information will be visualized in a publicly available, interactive database hosted on Tableau Public.

Abstrackr semi-automates citation screening by predicting relevant records. We evaluated its performance for four screening projects. METHODS: We used a convenience sample of screening projects completed at the Alberta Research Centre for Health Evidence, Edmonton, Canada: three SRs and one descriptive analysis for which we had used SR screening methods. The projects were heterogeneous with respect to search yield (median 9328; range 5243 to 47,385 records; interquartile range (IQR) 15,688 records), topic (Antipsychotics, Bronchiolitis, Diabetes, Child Health SRs), and screening complexity. We uploaded the records to Abstrackr and screened until it made predictions about the relevance of the remaining records. Across three trials for each project, we compared the predictions to human reviewer decisions and calculated the sensitivity, specificity, precision, false negative rate, proportion missed, and workload savings. RESULTS: Abstrackr\'s sensitivity was > 0.75 for all projects and the mean specificity ranged from 0.69 to 0.90 with the exception of Child Health SRs, for which it was 0.19. The precision (proportion of records correctly predicted as relevant) varied by screening task (median 26.6%; range 14.8 to 64.7%; IQR 29.7%). The median false negative rate (proportion of records incorrectly predicted as irrelevant) was 12.6% (range 3.5 to 21.2%; IQR 12.3%). The workload savings were often large (median 67.2%, range 9.5 to 88.4%; IQR 23.9%). The proportion missed (proportion of records predicted as irrelevant that were included in the final report, out of the total number predicted as irrelevant) was 0.1% for all SRs and 6.4% for the descriptive analysis. This equated to 4.2% (range 0 to 12.2%; IQR 7.8%) of the records in the final reports. CONCLUSIONS: Abstrackr\'s reliability and the workload savings varied by screening task. Workload savings came at the expense of potentially missing relevant records. How this might affect the results and conclusions of SRs needs to be evaluated. Studies evaluating Abstrackr as the second reviewer in a pair would be of interest to determine if concerns for reliability would diminish. Further evaluations of Abstrackr\'s performance and usability will inform its refinement and practical utility.','Gates A and Johnson C and Hartling L','Systematic reviews',NULL,'Canada,Humans,*Machine Learning,*Mass Screening,Records,Reproducibility of Results,Retrospective Studies,*Systematic Reviews as Topic'),(23,2,'25509715','25509715','How to reduce stigma in leprosy--a systematic literature review.','BACKGROUND: Interventions to reduce leprosy-related stigma reduce the manifestations of stigma that cause so much suffering to individuals and their families.

METHOD: Electronic searches were undertaken using PubMed (Medline), CINAHL and PsycInfo databases. The internet was searched using Google Scholar for papers not published in these databases. All relevant papers written in Thai or English were included. RESULTS: After reading 55 papers, three duplications and parallel literatures were removed, 18 were removed on abstract screening and nine after reading the full papers; eventually, 25 were included in this review.

However, previous studies indicated mixed results, possibly because of variability in terms of the nature of the exercise interventions. The purpose of this study was to perform a metaanalysis of current evidence from endurance exercise intervention studies for effects on the United Parkinson\'s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) in individuals with PD. A systematic literature search in six electronic databases was performed and two independent reviewers screened the title and abstract of 1106 records captured by the initial search. Inclusion criteria for full-text review were (A) peer-reviewed English-language publications, (B) randomized controlled trials that compared an endurance exercise intervention group to a non-exercising control group, and (C) an outcome measure which included the UPDRS total score or section III (motor) subscore. From the title/abstract screening, the same independent reviewers assessed 245 full-text articles for eligibility. Of the fulltext articles reviewed 7 articles were included in our meta-analysis, 238 were excluded for the following reasons: 147 did not meet endurance exercise criteria, 53 were review/systematic reviews, 34 were conference abstracts or posters, 2 were editorial or commentary, 1 was a study protocol, and 1 was unpublished. The d index was used to calculate the difference between means of different groups within individual studies, and a weighting factor or w was used to calculate the effect size across studies. Overall, d index was found to be -0.32 with 95% confidence interval, CI (-0.09, -0.56) found to be statistically significant indicating a positive effect of endurance exercise in UPDRS scores.

Gastroenterologists are often reluctant to perform endoscopic procedures despite urgent indications. We performed a systematic review of the literature to determine the safety of endoscopic procedures after MI. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled trials for controlled clinical trials or case series examining the diagnostic efficacy and complications of esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), colonoscopy and flexible sigmoidoscopy after MI. Title and abstract screening was followed by full-text review with subsequent data extraction of included studies. RESULTS: A total of seven studies met inclusion criteria. Four studies evaluated safety and efficacy of EGD after MI. The reported complication rate ranged between 1-8%, with a large predominance of minor complications. We found one study addressing safety of flexible sigmoidoscopy that reported minor complications in two patients. We also identified one study addressing the safety of colonoscopy after MI, which showed a complication rate of 9%. Most of these complications were minor. A decision analysis was also included in this review. CONCLUSIONS: Our review demonstrated that endoscopic procedures are safe and beneficial in stable patients with GI bleeding after recent MI and should be performed without a requisite delay.

Information on phantom design, used PI and phantom applications was extracted. RESULTS: Of 463 retrieved articles, 397 were rejected after abstract screening and 32 after full-text reading. The 37 accepted articles resulted to address PI simulation in brain (n = 11), myocardial (n = 8), liver (n = 2), tumour (n = 1), finger (n = 1), and non-specific tissue (n = 14), with diverse modalities: ultrasound (n = 11), computed tomography (n = 11), magnetic resonance imaging (n = 17), and positron emission tomography (n = 2). Three phantom designs were described: basic (n = 6), aligned capillary (n = 22), and tissue-filled (n = 12). Microvasculature and tissue perfusion were combined in one compartment (n = 23) or in two separated compartments (n = 17). With the only exception of one study, inter-compartmental fluid exchange could not be controlled. Nine studies compared phantom results with human or animal perfusion data.

The aim of this systematic scoping review was to describe empirical investigations of interventions designed to integrate physical, mental, and addiction healthcare for this population. An iterative and systematic search of five electronic databases (Medline (Ovid), PsycINFO, CINAHL, Embase (Ovid) and Scopus) was conducted to identify peer-reviewed articles published between January 2000 and April 2019. Two reviewers independently screened publications in two successive stages of title and abstract screening, followed by full-text screening of eligible publications. Data from each included publication were extracted independently by two reviewers using a standardised spreadsheet. A total of 28 eligible publications were identified, representing 25 unique studies. Over half of the included studies investigated the use of case managers to provide self-management skills or to coordinate mental and physical healthcare (n=14). Other interventions examined the co-location of services (n=9) and the implementation of screening and referral pathways to specialist treatment (n=2). Less than half of the included studies described a framework, theory or model that was underpinning the intervention tested.

Here, we estimated relapse rates during secondary prophylaxis with TMP-SMX, and further explored differences in relapse rates prior to introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and the widespread adoption of HAART. A systematic search of PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials yielded 707 studies whereby 663 were excluded after abstract screening, and 38 were excluded after full review leaving 6 studies for extraction. We performed double data extraction with a third-party adjudicator. Study designs varied with only one randomized study, four prospective cohorts and one retrospective cohort. Relapse rates were transformed using the Freeman-Tukey method and pooled using both fixed-effect and random-effects meta-analysis models. The TMP-SMX relapse rate was 16.4% (95% CI = 6.2% to 30.3%) based on random-effects models. When the disaggregated pre-HAART studies (n = 4) were included, the relapse rate was 14.9% (random effects; 95% CI = 3.7% to 31.9%).

Total hip replacement can reliably relieve pain and improve function in the majority of patients for a period of 15 to 20 years or more postoperatively. Physical therapy follows each total hip replacement surgery. Physical therapy protocols after total hip replacement in the post-discharge period vary widely in terms of setting (inpatient, outpatient), content (the particular set of exercises used), and frequency (e.g. daily versus twice a week). In current literature, there is no systematic review which has compared the effectiveness of inpatient and outpatient physical therapy in patients after total hip replacement in the post-discharge period. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this systematic review was to compare the effectiveness of inpatient physical therapy with outpatient physical therapy on the quality of life and gait measures in older adults after total hip replacement in the post-discharge period. INCLUSION CRITERIA: This review considered studies that include older adults (over 65 years) who have had total hip replacement and are in the post-discharge period. Adults with bilateral or multiple simultaneous surgeries and also patients who have had hemiarthroplasty of the hip joint were excluded.This review considered studies that included any type of physical therapy delivered in inpatient settings provided by professionals with education in physical therapy. Inpatient physical therapy delivered at any frequency and over any duration was included.This review considered studies that included as a comparator any type of physical therapy delivered in outpatient settings provided by professionals with education in physical therapy or no physical therapy.This review considered studies that included the following primary and secondary outcomes. The primary outcome was quality of life, assessed by any validated assessment tool. The secondary outcome was measures of gait assessed by any valid methods.This review considered both experimental and observational study designs including randomized controlled trials, non-randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental, before and after studies, prospective and retrospective cohort studies, case control studies and analytical cross sectional studies for inclusion. SEARCH STRATEGY: The search strategy aimed to find both published and unpublished studies. A three-step search strategy was utilized in 12 databases. Studies published in all languages and any date were considered for inclusion in this review. METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY: Assessment of methodological quality was not conducted as no studies were identified that met the inclusion criteria. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Data extraction and synthesis was not performed because no studies were included in this systematic review. RESULTS: During to the three-step search strategy 4330 papers were identified. The primary and secondary reviewer independently retrieved 42 potentially relevant papers according to the inclusion criteria by title and abstract screening. Following assessment of full text all of the retrieved papers were excluded based on the inclusion criteria. CONCLUSIONS: There is no scientific evidence comparing the effectiveness of inpatient physical therapy with outpatient physical therapy in older patients after total hip replacement in the post-discharge period. IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH: This systematic review has identified gaps in the literature for comparing the effectiveness of inpatient physical therapy with and outpatient physical therapy on the quality of life and gait measures in older adults after total hip replacement in the post-discharge period.

STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: PubMed was searched to identify systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials published in 2015 in English. After title and abstract screening, potentially relevant reviews were divided into three groups: registered non-Cochrane reviews, Cochrane reviews, and nonregistered reviews. For each group, random number tables were generated in Microsoft Excel, and the first 50 eligible studies from each group were randomly selected. Data of interest from systematic reviews were extracted. Regression analyses were conducted to explore the association between total Revised Assessment of Multiple Systematic Review (R-AMSTAR) or Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) scores and the selected characteristics of systematic reviews. RESULTS: The conducting and reporting of literature search in registered reviews were superior to nonregistered reviews. Differences in 9 of the 11 R-AMSTAR items were statistically significant between registered and nonregistered reviews. The total R-AMSTAR score of registered reviews was higher than nonregistered reviews [mean difference (MD) = 4.82, 95% confidence interval (CI): 3.70, 5.94]. Sensitivity analysis by excluding the registration-related item presented similar result (MD = 4.34, 95% CI: 3.28, 5.40). Total PRISMA scores of registered reviews were significantly higher than nonregistered reviews (all reviews: MD = 1.47, 95% CI: 0.64-2.30; non-Cochrane reviews: MD = 1.49, 95% CI: 0.56-2.42). However, the difference in the total PRISMA score was no longer statistically significant after excluding the item related to registration (item 5). Regression analyses showed similar results.

METHODS: This was a structured search of electronic databases up to September 2012 conducted by two independent reviewers. Publications containing proportions or descriptions of ADCA clinical features written in several languages were selected. Gray literature was included and a back-search was conducted of retrieved publication reference lists. Initial selection was based on title and abstract screening, followed by full-text reading of potentially relevant publications. Clinical findings and demographic data from genetically confirmed patients were extracted. Data were analyzed using the chi-squared test and controlled for alpha-error inflation by applying the Holms step-down procedure. RESULTS: In all, 1062 publications reviewing 12 141 patients (52% male) from 30 SCAs were analyzed. Mean age at onset was 35 +/- 11 years. Onset symptoms in 3945 patients revealed gait ataxia as the most frequent sign (68%), whereas overall non-ataxia symptom frequency was 50%. Some ADCAs often presented non-ataxia symptoms at onset, such as SCA7 (visual impairment), SCA14 (myoclonus) and SCA17 (parkinsonism). Therefore a categorization into two groups was established: pure ataxia and mainly non-ataxia forms. During overall disease course, dysarthria (90%) and saccadic eye movement alterations (69%) were the most prevalent non-ataxia findings. Some ADCAs were clinically restricted to cerebellar dysfunction, whilst others presented additional features. CONCLUSIONS: Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias encompass a broad spectrum of clinical features with high prevalence of non-ataxia symptoms. Certain features distinguish different genetic subtypes. A new algorithm for ADCA classification at disease onset is proposed.','Rossi M and Perez-Lloret S and Doldan L and Cerquetti D and Balej J and Millar Vernetti P and Hawkes H and Cammarota A and Merello M','European journal of neurology',NULL,'Adult,Age of Onset,Databases, Factual/statistics & numerical data,Female,Humans,Male,Middle Aged,Spinocerebellar Ataxias/*classification/genetics/*physiopathology,Young Adult'),(32,2,'25646166','25646166','Adhesion to zirconia used for dental restorations: a systematic review and meta-analysis.','PURPOSE: Currently, no consensus exists regarding the best adhesion protocol for zirconia used in dentistry; this is important particularly for restorations where mechanical retention is deficient. This systematic review analyzed the adhesion potential of resin-based and glass-ionomer luting cements to zirconia and aimed to highlight the possible dominant factors affecting the bond strength results to this substrate. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Original scientific papers on adhesion to zirconia published in the MEDLINE (PubMed) database between 01/01/1995 and 01/06/2011 were included in this systematic review. The following MeSH terms, search terms, and their combinations were used: \"Dental bonding\", \"Zirconium\", \"Zirconia\", \"Y-TZP\", \"Y-TZP ceramic\", \"Materials Testing/methods\", \"Test\", \"Cement\", and \"Resin bonding\". Two reviewers performed screening and data abstraction. Descriptive statistics were performed and the frequencies of the studied parameters, means, standard deviations, confidence intervals (95% CI; uncorrected and corrected), median values, and interquartile ranges (IQR) were calculated for the bond strength data reported for different factor levels: surface conditioning methods (control, physicochemical, physical, chemical), cements (bis-GMA-, MDP-, and 4-META-based resin cements, self-adhesive cements, glass ionomer), aging with and without thermocycling (TC), and test methods (macroshear, microshear, macrotensile, and microtensile). RESULTS: The final search provided 177 titles with abstracts. Further abstract screening yielded 72 articles, out of which 54 were found potentially appropriate to be included. After full text evaluation, 2 of these were eliminated. The selection process resulted in the final sample of 52 studies. In total, 169 different surface conditioning methods, mainly combinations of air-abrasion protocols and adhesive promoters (primers or silanes), were investigated. Altogether, the use of 5 types of cements and 4 testing methods was reported. While 26 studies were performed without TC as aging, 26 of them employed thermocycling at varying number of cycles. This review highlighted that adhesion of the luting cements is significantly influenced by the surface conditioning method (p = 0.044), cement type (p = 0.018), test method (p = 0.017) and aging condition (p = 0.003). In nonconditioned control groups without thermocycling, mean bond strength values ranged between 1.15 (IQR = 3.54) and 8.93 (IQR = 9), and 6.9 (IQR = 0) and 8.73 (IQR = 13.93) MPa for macroshear and macrotensile tests, respectively. After physical conditioning method, MDP monomer based cement presented the highest bond values compared to those of other resin cements using either the macrotensile (no TC: 34.2; IQR = 24.18 MPa, TC: 42.35; IQR = 0 MPa) or microtensile (no TC: 37.2; IQR = 41.5 MPa, TC: 17.1; IQR = 31.15 MPa) test method. CONCLUSION: Based on the results of this systematic review, increased adhesion could be expected after physicochemical conditioning of zirconia. MDP-based resin cements tend to present higher results than those of other cements types when tested using macro- and microtensile tests. Adhesion studies on zirconia and reporting of data require more standardization.','Ozcan M and Bernasconi M','The journal of adhesive dentistry',NULL,'Ceramics/chemistry,*Dental Bonding,Dental Materials/*chemistry,Glass Ionomer Cements/*chemistry,Humans,Resin Cements/*chemistry,Surface Properties,Yttrium/chemistry,Zirconium/*chemistry'),(33,2,'32813338','32813338','Experiences and perceptions of spousal/partner caregivers providing care for community-dwelling adults with dementia: a qualitative systematic review.','OBJECTIVE: The objective of this review was to synthesize evidence on the experiences and perceptions of spousal/partner caregivers of community-dwelling adults with dementia. INTRODUCTION: Currently 47 million people in the world have a diagnosis of dementia, and this number is predicted to climb to 75 million by 2030. The majority of care is provided by family members, particularly spouses/partners. Quantitative systematic reviews of spouse/partner caregivers demonstrate negative health effects for these caregivers. This review synthesized the qualitative evidence on the experiences of spousal/partner caregivers of people with dementia to further understanding how this care and the context of care contribute to the health and well-being of spousal/partner caregivers. INCLUSION CRITERIA: This review considered qualitative studies that explored the experiences of spousal/partner caregivers providing care for adults with dementia. The focus was on qualitative designs including, but not limited to, phenomenology, grounded theory, ethnography, action research, critical research and feminist research. METHODS: The search strategy used a three-step approach and was aimed at locating both published and unpublished studies. Key databases included MEDLINE, CINAHL, Embase, PsycINFO, Sociological Abstracts, ISI Web of Science, and Dissertation Abstracts International. Gray literature was searched using keywords from the database searches. The databases were searched from inception to February 2017, and a mix of controlled vocabulary (i.e. MeSH, CINAHL headings) and keywords were used to capture all existing qualitative studies related to the experiences and perceptions of spousal/partner caregivers providing unpaid care for adults with dementia. During the title and abstract screening, only English and French articles were included. The recommended JBI approach to study selection, critical appraisal, data extraction and data synthesis was used. Seven of the 10 critical appraisal criteria were deemed essential, with exceptions identified for criteria 1, 6 and 7. RESULTS: Nineteen studies were included in the review. Study designs included phenomenology (eight), grounded theory (five), qualitative description (four), ethnography (one) and narrative inquiry (one). The total number of participants was 248 (164 women and 84 men). The overall quality of the studies was rated as moderate on the ConQual score, with dependability rated as moderate and credibility rated as high. One hundred and fifty-five findings were aggregated into four categories and two synthesized findings. The two synthesized findings were \"the expectation to care in the midst of uncertainty and unpredictability\" and \"the caregiver as hostage\". CONCLUSIONS: This review provides a comprehensive understanding that can inform spousal/partner caregiver policies and programs. Evidence is required on the experiences and perceptions of caregivers across the gender continuum. Interventions and interventional research that mobilizes the evidence to date is essential for the future of caregivers. The limitations to this review include the possibility of missed studies, all study participants being in heterosexual relationships, and the majority of participants being Caucasian. Recommendations for practice, policy and research include the need for awareness of the extent of change in the lives of the person with dementia and the spousal/partner caregiver, the importance of support and respite, the need to tangibly recognize the value of the unpaid caregiver in a way that preserves the health and well-being of this group, and research is required that is culturally sensitive and reflects the experiences of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, transsexual, queer, questioning, intersex, asexual, ally, pansexual populations.','Macdonald M and Martin-Misener R and Weeks L and Helwig M and Moody E and MacLean H','JBI evidence synthesis',NULL,''),(34,2,'27045285','27045285','At-home vs In-office Bleaching: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.','OBJECTIVE: A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed to evaluate the risk and intensity of tooth sensitivity during in-office and at-home bleaching in adult patients. The efficacy of dental bleaching was also evaluated. METHODS: A comprehensive search was performed in the MEDLINE via PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature database, Brazilian Library in Dentistry, Cochrane Library, and System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe without restrictions. The annual conference of the International Association for Dental Research abstracts (1990-2014) and unpublished and ongoing trials registry were also searched. Dissertations and theses were searched using the ProQuest Dissertations and Periodicos Capes Theses databases. Only randomized clinical trials that compared the prevalence or intensity of tooth sensitivity during in-office and at-home bleaching in adult patients were included and studies that evaluated the efficacy of these dental bleaching techniques, in terms of shade guide units (DeltaSGU) and in terms of color difference measured with a spectrophotometer (DeltaE*). RESULTS: After the removal of duplicates, 1139 articles were identified. After title and abstract screening, 29 studies remained. Fifteen studies were further excluded, whereas 12 studies remained for qualitative analyses and 8 for the meta-analysis of the primary and secondary outcomes. No significant difference in the risk/intensity of tooth sensitivity or in bleaching efficacy was observed in the present study. CONCLUSION: In an overall comparison of at-home and in-office bleaching, no differences were detected, either regarding risk/intensity of tooth sensitivity or the effectiveness of the bleaching treatment.

Current literature reports many cases of acquired facial palsy that do not recover spontaneously, and more information is needed regarding the efficacy of physical therapies used in this population. Methods: A systematic search of eight electronic databases was performed from database inception to December 2018. Gray literature searches were then performed to identify additional articles. Studies were included if they addressed physical rehabilitation interventions for adults with acquired facial palsy. Reasons for exclusion were documented. Independent data extraction, quality assessment, and risk of bias assessment followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Results: Following abstract screening, a total of 13 full-text articles were identified for independent screening by two reviewers. This included four randomized control trials, two non-randomized control trials, one cohort study, and six prospective case series studies. Twelve out of the 13 included studies reported on facial palsy as a sequela of stroke. A total of 539 participants received intervention for facial palsy across the 13 included studies. Therapy design, length and frequency of intervention varied across the studies, and a wide range of outcome measures were used. Improvement on various outcome measures was reported across all 13 studies. The quality of the evidence was low overall, and most studies were found to have high risk of bias. Conclusions: All the studies in this review report improvement of facial movement or function following application of various methods of physical rehabilitation for facial palsy. Methodological limitations and heterogeneity of design affect the strength of the evidence and prevent reliable comparison between intervention methods. Strong evidence supporting physical rehabilitation was not found; well-designed rigorous research is required.','Vaughan A and Gardner D and Miles A and Copley A and Wenke R and Coulson S','Frontiers in neurology',NULL,''),(36,2,'32497369','32497369','Aggressive behaviour of persons with dementia towards professional caregivers in the home care setting-A scoping review.','AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To outline and to examine the current research and grey literature on aggressive incidents of persons with dementia towards professional caregivers in the home care setting. We intended to identify evidence and research gaps in this field. BACKGROUND: Worldwide, around fifty million people are living with dementia. Current research indicates that aggressive behaviour of persons with dementia towards professional caregivers occurs frequently in inpatient settings. However, there has been little research on this phenomenon in the home care setting. DESIGN: The design entails a scoping review using the methodological framework of Arksey and O\'Malley and PRISMA-ScR. METHODS: A systematic literature search in five databases and a web search in Google Scholar was conducted. Title and abstract screening and a full-text screening were conducted by two independent authors. A free web search for grey literature was conducted in Google. RESULTS: The search yielded 1,376 hits. A total of seven journal articles met the inclusion criteria. In the free web search, six references were identified for inclusion, resulting in a total of 13 references. We identified the following four themes: (1) aggressive behaviour in the context of dementia, (2) triggering factors of aggressive behaviour in persons with dementia, (3) skills and educational needs and (4) hindrances to solving the problem of aggressive behaviour. CONCLUSIONS: There is a lack of literature on aggressive behaviour of persons with dementia in the home care setting, and various hindrances to solving this problematic behaviour have been identified.

US and EU prescribing information and treatment guidelines from the NCCN, ASCO, and EORTC specify that pegfilgrastim, a long-acting (LA) G-CSF, should be administered at least 24 h after myelosuppressive chemotherapy. Nevertheless, many patients receive LA G-CSFs on the same day as chemotherapy. This systematic literature review evaluated the relative merits of same-day versus next-day dosing of LA G-CSFs. METHODS: A broad Ovid MEDLINE(R) and Embase(R) literature search was conducted that examined all publications indexed before May 9, 2016 that compared same-day versus next-day LA G-CSF administration. A congress abstract literature search included congresses from January 1, 2011 to April 6, 2016. The parameters for this review were prospectively delineated in a research protocol and adhered to the PRISMA Guidelines. RESULTS: The first part of the systematic literature search identified 1736 publications.

Despite ongoing efforts to diversify such treatments, evidence continues to illuminate modest rates of treatment engagement and perceived barriers to treatment. Patient-centred care (PCC) is one approach that may strengthen the responsiveness of treatments for people with problematic substance use. The aim of this scoping review is to explore how the principles of PCC have been implemented and operationalised in healthcare settings for people with problematic substance use. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This scoping review follows the iterative stages of the Arksey and O\'Malley framework. Both empirical (from Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL and ISI Web of Science) and grey literature references will be considered if they focused on populations with problematic substance use and described or measured PCC or one of its principles in a health-oriented context. Two reviewers will independently screen references in two successive stages of title/abstract screening and then full-text screening for references meeting title/abstract criteria. A descriptive overview, tabular and/or graphical summaries, and a directed content analysis will be carried out on extracted data. This scoping review has been registered with Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/5swvd/).

This review will develop a catalogue of these interventions, improving the understanding of how these interventions work, thereby facilitating efficient development and testing of participation-focused interventions. INTRODUCTION: Stroke rehabilitation interventions can be categorized as those aiming to correct impairment and those seeking participation improvement despite impairment. Impairment-focused interventions include a relatively small number of well-defined elements, generally based on motor learning or other types of learning theory. Participation-focused interventions span a large group of diverse interventions. The underlying theory is typically varied and often implicit, but many of these interventions are based on metacognitive or self-management approaches. An examination of the underlying theory and elements of participation-focused interventions would allow researchers to more effectively advance the science of these approaches.

There is a variation in practice in how bleeding is measured and defined. AIM: The primary objective of this study was to determine how investigators define and report bleeding outcome measures. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE and the CENTRAL were searched from January 1990 to January 2014. We retrieved all published studies that included patients with haemophilia A or B and reported some measures of bleeding. Two reviewers independently performed title and abstract screening, full-text review and data abstraction of the identified studies. RESULTS: A total of 118 studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Study designs were randomized controlled trials (RCT; 14%), cohort (68%), cross-sectional (5%) and others design (11%). The median duration of follow-up (Q1, Q3) was 20 (7.9, 50) months. We found 10 different bleeding outcomes reported [absolute number of bleeding 60 (50.8%) studies, annualized bleeding rate 60 (50.8%) studies, bleed per month 10 (8.5%) studies and others 11 (9.3%) studies]. Of these, 32 (27%) studies reported only mean or median without dispersion and 33 (28%) studies did not report any measures of central tendency (dispersion). CONCLUSIONS: There is substantial variation in definitions and measures of bleeding outcomes in the haemophilia literature. This creates difficulty and limitations in comparing the outcomes between studies and in performing meta-analysis. The haemophilia research community needs to develop a consensus on a clear definition of bleeding and how to address the limitations associated with variations in measures of bleeding between centres and studies.','Chai-Adisaksopha C and Hillis C and Thabane L and Iorio A','Haemophilia : the official journal of the World Federation of Hemophilia',NULL,'Hemophilia A/*complications,Hemophilia B/*complications,Hemorrhage/*complications,Humans,*Research Design'),(43,2,'32829469','32829469','Impacts of Gentrification on Health in the US: a Systematic Review of the Literature.','Gentrification in the largest 50 US cities has more than doubled since the 1990s. The process of gentrification can bring about improved neighborhood conditions, reduced rates of crime, and property value increases. At the same time, it can equally foster negative conditions associated with poorer health outcomes, such as disrupted social networks from residential displacement and increases in stress. While neighborhood environment is consistently implicated in health outcomes research, gentrification is rarely conceptualized as a public health issue. Though research on gentrification is growing, empirical studies evaluating the health impacts of gentrification in the US are poorly understood. Here we systematically review US population-based empirical studies examining relationships between gentrification and health. Electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Scopus, Web of Science, and Academic Search Complete) were searched using a combination of terms to identify peer-reviewed studies published on or before July 9, 2018, reporting associations between gentrification and health. Study title and abstract screenings were followed by full-text review of all studies meeting the following inclusion criteria of: >/= 1 quantitative measure of association for a health outcome, within the context of gentrification; peer-reviewed research; located in the US; and English language. Of 8937 studies identified, 6152 underwent title and abstract screening, and 50 studies underwent full-text screening, yielding six studies for review. Gentrification exposure measures and health outcomes examined varied widely. Most studies reported little to no overall association between gentrification and health outcomes; however, gentrification was repeatedly associated with undesirable health effects among Black and economically vulnerable residents. Despite seemingly overall null associations between gentrification and health, evidence suggests that gentrification may negatively impact the health of certain populations, particularly Black and low-income individuals. Complexities inherent in operationalizing gentrification point toward the need for validated measures. Additionally, understanding how gentrification-health associations differ across health endpoints, race/ethnicities, socioeconomic status, and life course can provide insight into whether this process contributes to urban inequality and health disparities. As gentrification occurs across the US, it is important to understand how this process impacts health. While aging cities reinvest in the revitalization of communities, empirical research examining relationships between gentrification and health can help inform policy decisions.','Smith GS and Breakstone H and Dean LT and Thorpe RJ Jr','Journal of urban health : bulletin of the New York Academy of Medicine',NULL,''),(44,2,'31594898','31594898','Association between quantitative sensory testing and pain or disability in paediatric chronic pain: protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis.','INTRODUCTION: This protocol describes the objective and methods of a systematic review of the association between quantitative sensory testing (QST) measures and pain intensity or disability in paediatric chronic pain (PCP). The review will also assess whether the relationship strength is moderated by variables related to the QST method and pain condition; the use of QST in PCP (modalities, outcome measures and anatomical test sites as well as differentiating between pain mechanisms (eg, neuropathic vs nociceptive) and in selecting analgesics); the reliability of QST across the paediatric age range; the ability of QST to differentiate patients with chronic pain from healthy controls; and differences between anatomical test sites. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Medline, PsycINFO, CINHAL, Web of Science, Scopus, Cochrane Library and OpenGrey will be searched. English language studies will be eligible if they recruit a sample aged 6-24 (inclusive) with chronic pain, including primary and secondary pain; apply at least one of the following QST modalities: chemical, electrical, mechanical (subgroups include pressure, punctate/brush and vibratory) or thermal stimulus to measure perception of noxious or innocuous stimuli applied to skin, muscle or joint; use a testing protocol to control for stimulus properties: modality, anatomical site, intensity, duration and sequence.

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing antiplatelet therapy and anticoagulation in patients with surgical BAVR. METHODS: We searched Cochrane CENTRAL, MEDLINE and EMBASE from inception to 3 November 2017 for studies evaluating antiplatelet therapy versus anticoagulation early after surgical BAVR. We performed title and abstract screening, full-text review, risk of bias evaluation and data collection independently and in duplicate. We evaluated overall quality of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework, and pooled data using a random effects model. RESULTS: We identified 2 RCTs (n = 397) and 5 observational studies (n = 2,012) meeting our eligibility criteria. The mean follow-up for all outcomes was 3 months in RCTs, and 10 months for observational studies. Antiplatelet compared with anticoagulant therapy demonstrated a trend towards fewer major bleeds in RCTs (relative risk [RR], 0.34; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.11-1.04, p = 0.06, I (2) = 0%, low quality evidence), and significantly fewer major bleeds in observational studies (RR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.20-0.58, p </= 0.0001, I (2) = 0%, very low quality evidence), but stroke, thromboembolism and mortality did not show a significant difference in either RCTs or observational studies. CONCLUSION: Antiplatelet therapy demonstrated reduced bleeding risk with no negative effects on stroke, thromboembolism or mortality compared with anticoagulation therapy after surgical BAVR. Our confidence in the results is reduced by the low quality of the available evidence.','An KR and Belley-Cote EP and Um KJ and Gupta S and McClure GR and Jaffer IH and Pandey A and Spence J and Van der Wall SJ and Eikelboom JW and Whitlock RP','Thrombosis and haemostasis',NULL,'Anticoagulants/*therapeutic use,Aortic Valve/*surgery,*Bioprosthesis,Blood Coagulation,Follow-Up Studies,Heart Valve Diseases/*surgery,Heart Valve Prosthesis,Hemorrhage/drug therapy,Humans,Observational Studies as Topic,Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors/*therapeutic use,Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic,Risk,Thromboembolism/prevention & control'),(46,2,'29327563','29327563','Hemodynamic outcomes of the Ross procedure versus other aortic valve replacement: a systematic review and meta-analysis.','INTRODUCTION: Life expectancy in young adults undergoing mechanical or bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement (AVR) may be reduced by up to 20 years compared to age matched controls. The Ross procedure is a durable, anticoagulation-sparing alternative. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare the valve hemodynamics of the Ross procedure versus other AVR. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: We searched Cochrane CENTRAL, MEDLINE and EMBASE from inception to February 2017 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies (n>/=10 Ross). Independently and in duplicate, we performed title and abstract screening, full-text eligibility assessment, and data collection. We evaluated the risk of bias with the Cochrane and CLARITY tools, and the quality of evidence with the GRADE framework. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: We identified 2 RCTs and 13 observational studies that met eligibility criteria (N.=1412). In observational studies, the Ross procedure was associated with a lower mean aortic gradient at discharge (MD -9 mmHg, 95% CI: -13 to -5, P<0.0001, I2=97%) and latest follow-up (MD -5 mmHg, 95% CI: -7 to -3, P<0.0001, I2=92%). There was no significant difference in the incidence of severe aortic regurgitation at latest follow-up (RR 1.3, 95% CI: 0.3 to 5.8, P=0.70, I2=30%). In RCTs, the Ross procedure was associated with a lower mean gradient at latest follow-up (MD -15 mmHg, 95% CI: -32 to 2, P=0.08, I2=99%). The mean pulmonic gradient for the Ross procedure was 18.0 mmHg (95% CI: 16 to 20, P<0.0001) at latest follow-up. The evidence for all outcomes from observational studies was deemed to be of very low quality, while the evidence from RCTs was downgraded for imprecision and moderately serious risk of bias.

Randomised clinical trials (RCTs) are the gold standard for assessing the safety and efficacy of interventions in this population. Heterogeneity in the outcomes measured and reported between RCTs limits the ability to compare, contrast, and combine trial results in a clinically meaningful way. There is currently no core outcome set (COS) available for use in RCTs evaluating interventions in adolescents with MDD. We will conduct a systematic scoping review of outcomes reported in adolescent depression RCTs to assess the variability of trial outcomes and to inform the development of a COS for adolescent MDD. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will apply methods based on the Joanna Briggs Institute scoping review methods manual. RCTs evaluating any treatment intervention for adolescent MDD published in the last 10 years will be located using an electronic bibliographic database search (MEDLINE, PsycINFO and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials). Title and abstract screening, full-text screening, and data charting of eligible studies will be performed in duplicate. Outcomes identified will be mapped to an outcome-domain framework. Data analysis will include summary statistics of the characteristics of the included trials and outcomes. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The results of this review will inform the development of a COS for adolescent MDD. The development and implementation of a COS for RCTs evaluating interventions in adolescents with MDD promise to help reduce variability in trial outcome selection, definition, measurement and reporting, ultimately facilitating evidence synthesis that will help to identify the best treatment practices for adolescents with MDD.','Monsour A and Mew EJ and Szatmari P and Patel S and Saeed L and Offringa M and Butcher NJ','BMJ open',NULL,'Adolescent,Depressive Disorder, Major/*therapy,Humans,*Outcome Assessment, Health Care,Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic'),(48,2,'26610023','26610023','Building capacity for education research among clinical educators in the health professions: A BEME (Best Evidence Medical Education) Systematic Review of the outcomes of interventions: BEME Guide No. 34.','BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: There is a growing desire for health professions educators to generate high-quality education research; yet, few of them encounter the training to do so. In response, health professions faculties have increasingly been devoting resources to provide members with the skills necessary for education research. The form and impact of these efforts have not been reviewed, though such a synthesis could be useful for practice. The objectives of this systematic review were to (1) identify interventions aimed at building capacity for education research among health professions clinical educators and (2) review the outcomes of these interventions. METHODOLOGY: We developed a systematic review protocol based on our pilot scoping search. This protocol underwent peer review and was prospectively registered with the Best Evidence Medical Education Collaboration. Based on this protocol, we conducted a comprehensive search of health professions\' databases and related grey literature. Systematic methods were applied: two independent reviewers completed title screening and full text review for inclusion, data extraction, and methodological quality assessment. Studies were included if they reported outcomes for interventions designed to increase capacity for health professions clinical educators to conduct education research. We conducted a qualitative synthesis of the evidence which included detailed reporting of intervention characteristics and outcomes. RESULTS: Our search returned 14, 149 results, 241 of which were retained after title and abstract screening, and 30 of which met inclusion criteria after full text review. Seven groups of interventions were identified, the most frequent being teaching scholars programs (n = 10), health professions education fellowships (n = 3) or master\'s programs (n = 4). The most commonly measured outcome was change related to enhanced scholarly outputs (grants, papers, abstracts, and presentations) post-intervention. Unfortunately, most of the included studies lacked detailed description of the intervention and were of low to moderate quality with post-test only design. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSIONS: This review demonstrates that various interventions can have a positive impact on the ability of health professions clinical educators to conduct education research. We note several key elements of the interventions including: (1) protected time, (2) mentorship and/or collaboration, (3) departmental and institutional commitment and leadership, and (4) financial support. Through our analysis we describe the complexities around evaluating clinical educators\' health professions research activities and the interventions used to promote education research. While improved study quality would allow more detailed understanding and evaluation of these key features, we are able to provide recommendations for potential strategies for improving participation in and quality of health professions education research based on this analysis.','Ahmed R and Farooq A and Storie D and Hartling L and Oswald A','Medical teacher',NULL,'Capacity Building/*methods,*Faculty, Medical,*Health Occupations,*Research'),(49,2,'29738745','29738745','Efficacy of Exercise Interventions in Patients With Advanced Cancer: A Systematic Review.','OBJECTIVE: To critically analyze the literature surrounding the efficacy of exercise interventions in patients with advanced cancer. DATA SOURCES: A literature search was undertaken of health and medical electronic databases (PubMED, Medline, CINAHL, Embase, PEDRO, Web of Science, Scopus) until March 1, 2017. STUDY SELECTION: Studies were included if they were published in the English language and met the following criteria: structured exercise as the primary intervention, >/=80% study participants diagnosed with advanced cancer that is unlikely to be cured; reported outcomes concerning physical function, quality of life, fatigue, body composition, psychosocial function, sleep quality pain, and/or survival. DATA EXTRACTION: After title and abstract screening, 68 articles were eligible for full-text review, with a total of 25 studies (n=1188; 16 controlled trials, 9 noncontrolled trials) included in the quantitative synthesis. Two reviewers assessed methodological quality using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool for controlled trials and a modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for noncontrolled trials. DATA SYNTHESIS: Aerobic exercise was used in 6 studies, resistance training in 3 studies, and combination training (aerobic and resistance) in 15 studies. Significant between- and within-group improvements were reported with exercise in >/=50% of studies assessing physical function (83%), quality of life (55%), fatigue (50%), body composition (56%), psychosocial function (56%), and sleep quality (100%). Improvement within or between groups in pain after exercise was only observed in 2 studies (25%), whereas survival was unaffected in any study. CONCLUSIONS: Most studies reported significant between- and/or within-group improvements in physical function, quality of life, fatigue, body composition, psychosocial function, and sleep quality in patients with advanced cancer, although the effects on pain and survival rates are unclear. Exercise appears to be an effective adjunct therapy in the advanced cancer context, although targeted studies are required to determine the optimal exercise dose to enhance outcomes for specific cancer diagnoses.','Heywood R and McCarthy AL and Skinner TL','Archives of physical medicine and rehabilitation',NULL,'Adolescent,Adult,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Exercise Therapy/*methods,Female,Humans,Male,Middle Aged,Neoplasms/*rehabilitation,Quality of Life,Treatment Outcome,Young Adult'),(50,2,'24489868','24489868','Is anterior cervical discectomy and fusion superior to corpectomy and fusion for treatment of multilevel cervical spondylotic myelopathy? A systemic review and meta-analysis.','OBJECTIVE: Both anterior cervical discectomy with fusion (ACDF) and anterior cervical corpectomy with fusion (ACCF) are used to treat cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM), however, there is considerable controversy as to whether ACDF or ACCF is the optimal treatment for this condition. To compare the clinical outcomes, complications, and surgical trauma between ACDF and ACCF for the treatment of CSM, we conducted a meta-analysis. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive search in MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, Google Scholar and Cochrane databases, searching for relevant controlled trials up to July 2013 that compared ACDF and ACCF for the treatment of CSM. We performed title and abstract screening and full-text screening independently and in duplicate. A random effects model was used for heterogeneous data; otherwise, a fixed effect model was used to pool data, using mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes and odds ratio (OR) for dichotomous outcomes. RESULTS: Of 2157 citations examined, 15 articles representing 1372 participants were eligible. Overall, there were significant differences between the two treatment groups for hospital stay (M = -5.60, 95% CI = -7.09 to -4.11), blood loss (MD = -151.35, 95% CI = -253.22 to -49.48), complications (OR = 0.50, 95% CI = 0.35 to 0.73) and increased lordosis of C2-C7 (MD = 3.70, 95% CI = 0.96 to 6.45) and fusion segments angles (MD = 3.38, 95% CI = 2.54 to 4.22). However, there were no significant differences in the operation time (MD = -9.34, 95% CI = -42.99 to 24.31), JOA (MD = 0.24, 95% CI = -0.10 to 0.57), VAS (MD = -0.06, 95% CI = -0.81 to 0.70), NDI (MD = -1.37, 95% CI = -3.17 to 0.43), Odom criteria (OR = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.60 to 1.30) or fusion rate (OR = 1.17, 95% CI = 0.34 to 4.11).

The quality of abstracts was assessed by PRISMA-Abstract checklist comprising of 12 items; one each for title and objective, three items for methods, three items for results, two items for discussion and two items for others. PRISMA-A median scores were calculated and compared with the article characteristics. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05 and multi-variate analysis was performed using Kruskal-Wallis test. RESULTS: A total of 24 studies were included in the analysis. The mean PRISMA-Abstract score was 7.46 +/- 1.19. None of the studies were of high quality (score 10-12), 20 were of moderate (score 7-9), and 4 were of low quality (score 1-6).

The purpose of this scoping review was to describe the nature and extent of barriers and facilitators to aerobic exercise implementation with adults post-stroke as reported by health care professionals. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and AMED Allied and Complementary Medicine were searched from inception to October 16, 2019. Research studies that examined health care professionals\' barriers and facilitators to aerobic exercise implementation in adults post-stroke were included. Two reviewers independently conducted title and abstract screening, full-text evaluation, data extraction, and quality appraisal. The Theoretical Domains Framework was used to map the identified barriers or facilitators and to analyze and interpret the results. RESULTS: Four studies were included in the review. All studies involved surveys conducted among physical therapists and reported barriers related to \"environmental context and resources\" (eg, lack of equipment, time, staff), insufficient \"knowledge\" and \"skills\" (eg, safe aerobic exercise prescription and implementation), \"beliefs about capabilities\" (eg, uncertainty about exercise intensity and screening tools), and professional role and identity (eg, aerobic exercise not a priority). Access to and continued education in structured aerobic exercise programs and safety monitoring were identified facilitators. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Some of the identified barriers could be overcome with modeling and training in best practice, while others may require interventions targeting organizational environment and leadership. Future knowledge translation interventions should target the identified barriers and facilitators to implementing aerobic exercise.Video Abstract available for more insights from the authors (see the Video, Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/JNPT/A312).','Moncion K and Biasin L and Jagroop D and Bayley M and Danells C and Mansfield A and Salbach NM and Inness E and Tang A','Journal of neurologic physical therapy : JNPT',NULL,''),(53,2,'29916138','29916138','Paracetamol in Older People: Towards Evidence-Based Dosing?','Paracetamol is the most commonly used analgesic in older people, and is mainly dosed according to empirical dosing guidelines. However, the pharmacokinetics and thereby the effects of paracetamol can be influenced by physiological changes occurring with ageing. To investigate the steps needed to reach more evidence-based paracetamol dosing regimens in older people, we applied the concepts used in the paediatric study decision tree. A search was performed to retrieve studies on paracetamol pharmacokinetics and safety in older people (> 60 years) or studies that performed a (sub) analysis of pharmacokinetics and/or safety in older people. Of 6088 articles identified, 259 articles were retained after title and abstract screening. Further abstract and full-text screening identified 27 studies, of which 20 described pharmacokinetics and seven safety. These studies revealed no changes in absorption with ageing. A decreased (3.9-22.9%) volume of distribution (Vd) in robust older subjects and a further decreased Vd (20.3%) in frail older compared with younger subjects was apparent. Like Vd, age and frailty decreased paracetamol clearance (29-45.7 and 37.5%) compared with younger subjects. Due to limited and heterogeneous evidence, it was difficult to draw firm and meaningful conclusions on changed risk for paracetamol safety in older people. This review is a first step towards bridging knowledge gaps to move to evidence-based paracetamol dosing in older subjects. Remaining knowledge gaps are safety when using therapeutic dosages, pharmacokinetics changes in frail older people, and to what extent changes in paracetamol pharmacokinetics should lead to a change in dosage in frail and robust older people.','Mian P and Allegaert K and Spriet I and Tibboel D and Petrovic M','Drugs & aging',NULL,'Acetaminophen/*administration & dosage,Aged,Analgesics, Non-Narcotic/*administration & dosage,Dose-Response Relationship, Drug,Humans,Middle Aged'),(54,2,'29029859','29029859','Intensive insulin therapy, insulin sensitisers and insulin secretagogues for burns: A systematic review of effectiveness and safety.','This systematic review investigated the effectiveness and safety of intensive insulin therapy (IIT), insulin secretagogues and sensitisers in burn patients.

Administration of medication-assisted treatments (MATs) for OUD on an individual-dose basis has been shown to affect patient responses to treatment, proving to be, on occasion, dangerous. A genetic basis has been identified for some MAT responses in a candidate gene context, but consensus has not been reached for any genome-wide significant associations. This systematic review aims to identify and assess any genetic variants associated with MAT patient outcomes at genome-wide significance.

However, we do not know whether this is effective in changing dietary behaviour. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of one-to-one dietary interventions for all ages carried out in a dental care setting in changing dietary behaviour. The effectiveness of these interventions in the subsequent changing of oral and general health is also assessed. SEARCH METHODS: The following electronic databases were searched: the Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register (to 24 January 2012), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 1), MEDLINE via OVID (1950 to 24 January 2012), EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 24 January 2012), CINAHL via EBSCO (1982 to 24 January 2012), PsycINFO via OVID (1967 to 24 January 2012), and Web of Science (1945 to 12 April 2011). We also undertook an electronic search of key conference proceedings (IADR and ORCA between 2000 and 13 July 2011). Reference lists of relevant articles, thesis publications (Dissertations Abstracts Online 1861 to 2011) were searched. The authors of eligible trials were contacted to identify any unpublished work. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials assessing the effectiveness of one-to-one dietary interventions delivered in a dental care setting. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Abstract screening, eligibility screening and data extraction decisions were all carried out independently and in duplicate by two review authors. Consensus between the two opinions was achieved by discussion, or involvement of a third review author. MAIN RESULTS: Five studies met the criteria for inclusion in the review. Two of these were multi-intervention studies where the dietary intervention was one component of a wider programme of prevention, but where data on dietary behaviour change were reported. One of the single intervention studies was concerned with dental caries prevention. The other two concerned general health outcomes. There were no studies concerned with dietary change aimed at preventing tooth erosion. In four out of the five included studies a significant change in dietary behaviour was found for at least one of the primary outcome variables. AUTHORS\' CONCLUSIONS: There is some evidence that one-to-one dietary interventions in the dental setting can change behaviour, although the evidence is greater for interventions aiming to change fruit/vegetable and alcohol consumption than for those aiming to change dietary sugar consumption.

Aim: To establish a better understanding of the management of RHIVC injuries and to identify any adjuncts or operative methods that were associated with an increased survival. Methods: A systematic review of the MEDLINE database was conducted using Medical Search Headings and exploded keywords and phrases. Studies were screened and subjected to inclusion/exclusion criteria. Data were extracted in a methodical manner collecting population demographics, morbidity, mortality and operative intervention, where provided. Operative strategies were compared and discussed. Results: An initial search identified 483 articles. Following duplicate removal and abstract screening, 85 full-text articles were assessed with 25 meeting the desired criteria and were, therefore, included in the systematic review. Key operative strategies and complications were identified and discussed. Conclusion: The wide variety of operative interventions in the management of RHIVC liver injuries described attest to the increased efforts to improve outcomes. The overall improvement in mortality can be noted since the earlier descriptions reported mortality approaching 100% compared to the 52% reported in this review.

Our aim was to describe the process, facilitators, and barriers to completing the first 2-week full SR. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We systematically reviewed evidence of the impact of increased fluid intake, on urinary tract infection (UTI) recurrence, in individuals at risk for UTIs. The review was conducted by experienced systematic reviewers with complementary skills (two researcher clinicians, an information specialist, and an epidemiologist), using Systematic Review Automation tools, and blocked off time for the duration of the project. The outcomes were time to complete the SR, time to complete individual SR tasks, facilitators and barriers to progress, and peer reviewer feedback on the SR manuscript. Times to completion were analyzed quantitatively (minutes and calendar days); facilitators and barriers were mapped onto the Theoretical Domains Framework; and peer reviewer feedback was analyzed quantitatively and narratively. RESULTS: The SR was completed in 61 person-hours (9 workdays; 12 calendar days); accepted version of the manuscript required 71 person-hours. Individual SR tasks ranged from 16 person-minutes (deduplication of search results) to 461 person-minutes (data extraction). The least time-consuming SR tasks were obtaining full-texts, searches, citation analysis, data synthesis, and deduplication. The most time-consuming tasks were data extraction, write-up, abstract screening, full-text screening, and risk of bias. Facilitators and barriers mapped onto the following domains: knowledge; skills; memory, attention, and decision process; environmental context and resources; and technology and infrastructure. Two sets of peer reviewer feedback were received on the manuscript: the first included 34 comments requesting changes, 17 changes were made, requiring 173 person-minutes; the second requested 13 changes, and eight were made, requiring 121 person-minutes. CONCLUSION: A small and experienced systematic reviewer team using Systematic Review Automation tools who have protected time to focus solely on the SR can complete a moderately sized SR in 2 weeks.','Clark J and Glasziou P and Del Mar C and Bannach-Brown A and Stehlik P and Scott AM','Journal of clinical epidemiology',NULL,''),(61,2,'27107451','27107451','An appraisal of published usability evaluations of electronic health records via systematic review.','OBJECTIVE: In this systematic review, we aimed to evaluate methodological and reporting trends present in the current literature by investigating published usability studies of electronic health records (EHRs). METHODS: A literature search was conducted for articles published through January 2015 using MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE, Scopus, and Web of Science, supplemented by citation and reference list reviews. Studies were included if they tested the usability of hospital and clinic EHR systems in the inpatient, outpatient, emergency department, or operating room setting. RESULTS: A total of 4848 references were identified for title and abstract screening. Full text screening was performed for 197 articles, with 120 meeting the criteria for study inclusion. CONCLUSION: A review of the literature demonstrates a paucity of quality published studies describing scientifically valid and reproducible usability evaluations at various stages of EHR system development. A lack of formal and standardized reporting of EHR usability evaluation results is a major contributor to this knowledge gap, and efforts to improve this deficiency will be one step of moving the field of usability engineering forward.','Ellsworth MA and Dziadzko M and O\'Horo JC and Farrell AM and Zhang J and Herasevich V','Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA',NULL,'*Electronic Health Records,Evaluation Studies as Topic,Humans,Medical Informatics'),(62,2,'27334375','27334375','Effect of propofol and remifentanil on cerebral perfusion and oxygenation in pigs: a systematic review.','The objective of this review is to evaluate the existing literature with regard to the influence of propofol and remifentanil total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) on cerebral perfusion and oxygenation in healthy pigs. Anaesthesia has influence on cerebral haemodynamics and it is important not only in human but also in veterinary anaesthesia to preserve optimal regulation of cerebral haemodynamics. Propofol and remifentanil are widely used in neuroanaesthesia and are increasingly used in experimental animal studies. In translational models, the pig has advantages compared to small laboratory animals because of brain anatomy, metabolism, neurophysiological maturation, and cerebral haemodynamics. However, reported effects of propofol and remifentanil on cerebral perfusion and oxygenation in pigs have not been reviewed. An electronic search identified 99 articles in English. Title and abstract screening selected 29 articles for full-text evaluation of which 19 were excluded with reasons. Of the 10 peer-reviewed articles included for review, only three had propofol or remifentanil anaesthesia as the primary study objective and only two directly investigated the effect of anaesthesia on cerebral perfusion and oxygenation (CPO). The evidence evaluated in this systematic review is limited, not focused on propofol and remifentanil and possibly influenced by factors of potential importance for CPO assessment. In one study of healthy pigs, CPO measures were within normal ranges following propofol-remifentanil anaesthesia, and addition of a single remifentanil bolus did not affect regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2). Even though the pool of evidence suggests that propofol and remifentanil alone or in combination have limited effects on CPO in healthy pigs, confirmative evidence is lacking.','Mikkelsen ML and Ambrus R and Miles JE and Poulsen HH and Moltke FB and Eriksen T','Acta veterinaria Scandinavica',NULL,'Animals,Brain/*blood supply/*drug effects,Hypnotics and Sedatives/pharmacology,Oxygen/*metabolism,Periodicals as Topic,Piperidines/*pharmacology,Propofol/*pharmacology,Remifentanil,Swine'),(63,2,'28720117','28720117','Systematic review adherence to methodological or reporting quality.','BACKGROUND: Guidelines for assessing methodological and reporting quality of systematic reviews (SRs) were developed to contribute to implementing evidence-based health care and the reduction of research waste. As SRs assessing a cohort of SRs is becoming more prevalent in the literature and with the increased uptake of SR evidence for decision-making, methodological quality and standard of reporting of SRs is of interest. The objective of this study is to evaluate SR adherence to the Quality of Reporting of Meta-analyses (QUOROM) and PRISMA reporting guidelines and the A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) and Overview Quality Assessment Questionnaire (OQAQ) quality assessment tools as evaluated in methodological overviews. METHODS: The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE(R), and EMBASE(R) databases were searched from January 1990 to October 2014. Title and abstract screening and full-text screening were conducted independently by two reviewers. Reports assessing the quality or reporting of a cohort of SRs of interventions using PRISMA, QUOROM, OQAQ, or AMSTAR were included. All results are reported as frequencies and percentages of reports and SRs respectively. RESULTS: Of the 20,765 independent records retrieved from electronic searching, 1189 reports were reviewed for eligibility at full text, of which 56 reports (5371 SRs in total) evaluating the PRISMA, QUOROM, AMSTAR, and/or OQAQ tools were included. Notable items include the following: of the SRs using PRISMA, over 85% (1532/1741) provided a rationale for the review and less than 6% (102/1741) provided protocol information. For reports using QUOROM, only 9% (40/449) of SRs provided a trial flow diagram. However, 90% (402/449) described the explicit clinical problem and review rationale in the introduction section. Of reports using AMSTAR, 30% (534/1794) used duplicate study selection and data extraction. Conversely, 80% (1439/1794) of SRs provided study characteristics of included studies. In terms of OQAQ, 37% (499/1367) of the SRs assessed risk of bias (validity) in the included studies, while 80% (1112/1387) reported the criteria for study selection.

This systematic review (PROSPERO 2016:CRD42016039101) analyses whether this improves TB treatment outcomes. OBJECTIVES: Among people with drug-susceptible TB and DM on anti-TB treatment, to determine the effect of i) glycemic control (stringent or less stringent) compared to poor glycemic control and ii) insulin (only or with OHAs) compared to \'OHAs only\' on unsuccessful TB treatment outcome(s). We looked for unfavourable TB treatment outcomes at the end of intensive phase and/or end of TB treatment (minimum six months and maximum 12 months follow up). Secondary outcomes were development of MDR-TB during the course of treatment, recurrence after 6 months and/or after 1 year post successful treatment completion and development of adverse events related to glucose lowering treatment (including hypoglycemic episodes). METHODS: All interventional studies (with comparison arm) and cohort studies on people with TB-DM on anti-TB treatment reporting glycemic control, DM treatment details and TB treatment outcomes were eligible. We searched electronic databases (EMBASE, PubMed, Google Scholar) and grey literature between 1996 and April 2017. Screening, data extraction and risk of bias assessment were done independently by two investigators and recourse to a third investigator, for resolution of differences. RESULTS: After removal of duplicates from 2326 identified articles, 2054 underwent title and abstract screening. Following full text screening of 56 articles, nine cohort studies were included. Considering high methodological and clinical heterogeneity, we decided to report the results qualitatively and not perform a meta-analysis. Eight studies dealt with glycemic control, of which only two were free of the risk of bias (with confounder-adjusted measures of effect). An Indian study reported 30% fewer unsuccessful treatment outcomes (aOR (0.95 CI): 0.72 (0.64-0.81)) and 2.8 times higher odds of \'no recurrence\' (aOR (0.95 CI): 2.83 (2.60-2.92)) among patients with optimal glycemic control at baseline. A Peruvian study reported faster culture conversion among those with glycemic control (aHR (0.95 CI): 2.2 (1.1,4)). Two poor quality studies reported the effect of insulin on TB treatment outcomes. CONCLUSION: We identified few studies that were free of the risk of bias. There were limited data and inconsistent findings among available studies.

High-quality SRs follow strict procedures and require significant resources and time. We investigated advanced text-mining approaches to reduce the burden associated with abstract screening in SRs and provide high-level information summary. A text-mining SR supporting framework consisting of three self-defined semantics-based ranking metrics was proposed, including keyword relevance, indexed-term relevance and topic relevance. Keyword relevance is based on the user-defined keyword list used in the search strategy. Indexed-term relevance is derived from indexed vocabulary developed by domain experts used for indexing journal articles and books. Topic relevance is defined as the semantic similarity among retrieved abstracts in terms of topics generated by latent Dirichlet allocation, a Bayesian-based model for discovering topics. We tested the proposed framework using three published SRs addressing a variety of topics (Mass Media Interventions, Rectal Cancer and Influenza Vaccine). The results showed that when 91.8%, 85.7%, and 49.3% of the abstract screening labor was saved, the recalls were as high as 100% for the three cases; respectively. Relevant studies identified manually showed strong topic similarity through topic analysis, which supported the inclusion of topic analysis as relevance metric. It was demonstrated that advanced text mining approaches can significantly reduce the abstract screening labor of SRs and provide an informative summary of relevant studies.','Li D and Wang Z and Wang L and Sohn S and Shen F and Murad MH and Liu H','American journal of information management',NULL,''),(66,2,'22079937','22079937','Psychosocial interventions in workplace mental health promotion: an overview.','A review based on the DataPrev final report concerning workplace mental health promotion is presented.

The most frequent aims were stress reduction and better coping, followed by increased job satisfaction and effectiveness, mental health enhancement and reduction in mental health-related absenteeism. In the 79 intervention studies, 99 outcome variables were measured using 163 instruments, mostly developed for the study purposes. Different intervention categories turned out to be used to attain the same aim, with skills training being the most popular (other approaches included improvement of occupational qualifications and working conditions, physical exercise, relaxation and multicomponent interventions).

METHODS: A systematic review used MEDLINE and EMBASE to identify published literature from 2005 to 2016 addressing how stakeholders-patients, caregivers, and others-assisted researchers conducting pharmacoepidemiologic research. Three pairs of Workgroup members screened titles and abstracts to select articles for full-text review and analysis. Two Workgroup members abstracted the following data: research focus, characterization and role of stakeholders, and type(s) of engagement strategy employed. Data were summarized descriptively. RESULTS: We identified 5717 references for abstract screening. Of these, 69 met the criteria for full-text screening, and 11 were selected for data abstraction. Of these 11 studies, seven focused on the development of a research agenda and eight had stakeholders react or advise on an aspect of the study. Although patients were the most commonly identified stakeholders, advocacy groups and health care professionals were also frequently identified. Some studies reported the engagement of other stakeholders, including local government or policy experts. Engagement strategies varied, with five studies using more than one strategy. Studies often did not indicate the involvement of stakeholders in developing the study design or with implementation.

METHODS: We searched Embase, Web of Science, and PubMed for English language full-text articles reporting results from studies of HRQoL in patients with adult-onset DM1 published between 1 January 2000 and 21 February 2018. We excluded reviews, editorials, and studies reporting results for a sample with fewer than five patients (to allow for meaningful inference). RESULTS: The search identified 266 unique publications.

Transferring dying patients home is recognized to be complex but transfer decision-making itself remains unclear. DESIGN: Integrative review. DATA SOURCES: Seven bibliographic databases (origin-2015), grey literature and reference lists were searched. REVIEW METHODS: An integrative review method was used to synthesize data from diverse sources. Papers were selected through title and abstract screening and full-text reviewing, using inclusion and exclusion criteria derived from review questions. Following quality appraisal, data were extracted and synthesized using normalization process theory as a framework. RESULTS: The number of patients transferred home ranged from 1-346, with most papers reporting on the transfer of one or two patients. Four themes regarding transfer decision-making work were generated: divergent views and practice, multiple stakeholders\' involvement in decision-making, collective work and limited understanding of individuals\' experiences. CONCLUSION: The practice of transferring patients home to die and its decision-making varies internationally and is usually influenced by the care system, culture or religion. It is less common to transfer patients home to die from critical care units in western societies.

Although the etiology remains unclear, sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) and sleep apnea have been suggested to play an important role. Recent research has suggested a potential therapeutic benefit of adenotonsillectomy (T&A) and surgical management of upper airway obstruction in the treatment of PNE. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to conduct a systematic review of relevant literature to determine the effectiveness of T&A in treating children aged 2-19 years with PNE. STUDY DESIGN: This was a systematic review using a comprehensive electronic search strategy that included PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, conference proceedings, and the gray literature up to July 2015. We included all studies of children aged 2-19 years with PNE and SDB who underwent T&A. The primary outcome was resolution of PNE following surgery. Observational studies and randomized trials were reviewed. Risk of bias assessment and meta-analyses of included studies were performed. RESULTS: We screened 3254 citations; following title and abstract screening, 42 studies were selected for full-text screening by two independent reviewers. We included 18 studies (890 patients) in our final analysis. All studies were observational and only one included a control group. Meta-analysis of proportions of all (18) studies revealed a pooled complete resolution rate of 51% (43-60%), with significant heterogeneity among studies (I(2) = 82.2%). Partial resolution was seen in 20% (14-27%), with similar heterogeneity to the complete resolution group. Sensitivity analysis including only studies with a low risk of bias and with patients >/=5 years (n = 244 patients) yielded a complete resolution rate of 43% (36-49%) with minimal heterogeneity (I(2) = 0%; figure). CONCLUSION: In our systematic review, T&A resulted in improvement of nocturnal enuresis in more than 60% of patients, with complete resolution rates in excess of 50%. Findings were persistent on meta-analysis focused only on studies including older patients (>/=5 years) and those with short follow-up after surgery (</=3 months), which imply a higher cure rate than would be expected based on natural history alone. The limitations of this review include the lack of controlled trials, the overall quality of the evidence reviewed and the heterogeneity between included studies. The role for systematic investigation and treatment of sleep disorders in patients with PNE should be scrutinized further, since a near 50% complete resolution rate for PNE may be expected with T&A in some settings.','Lehmann KJ and Nelson R and MacLellan D and Anderson P and Romao RLP','Journal of pediatric urology',NULL,'Adenoidectomy/*methods,Adolescent,Child,Child, Preschool,Female,Follow-Up Studies,Humans,Male,Nocturnal Enuresis/*etiology/surgery,Risk Assessment,Sleep Apnea Syndromes/*complications/physiopathology/surgery,Tonsillectomy/*methods,Treatment Outcome'),(72,2,'32857457','32857457','All-cause and cause-specific mortality among people with regular or problematic cocaine use: A systematic review and meta-analysis.','AIMS: To estimate pooled all-cause and cause-specific mortality risk for people with regular or problematic cocaine use.

We carried out a systematic review with the following search terms: \'tDCS\', \'electric brain stimulation\', \'schizophrenia\', \'cognitive\', \'cognition\' until March 2019. 659 records were identified initially, 612 of which were excluded after abstract screening. The remaining 47 articles were assessed for eligibility based on our criteria and 26 studies were excluded. In addition, we compared several variables, such as online vs. offline-stimulation protocols, stimulation type and intensity on mediating positive vs. negative study outcomes. The majority of studies (n = 21) identified significant behavioural and neural effects on a range of cognitive functions (versus n = 11 with null results), including working memory, attention and social cognition. However, we could not identify tDCS parameters (electrode montage, stimulation protocol, type and intensity) that clearly mediated effects on cognitive deficits. There is preliminary evidence for the possibility that tDCS may improve cognitive deficits in schizophrenia.

This intervention entails the mobilisation of volunteers, known as Community First Responders (CFRs), by the Emergency Medical Services to respond to medical emergencies in their locality. They include lay responders and/or professional responders (e.g. police officers, fire fighters, and general practitioners). A wide variety of factors are thought to motivate CFRs to join and remain engaged in Voluntary First Response schemes, such as the availability of learning opportunities, recognition, counselling, and leadership. The aim of this review is to develop an in-depth understanding of CFR motivation, including the factors that influence the initial decision to volunteer as a CFR and the factors that sustain involvement in Voluntary First Response over time. Any factors relevant to CFR de-motivation and turnover will also be examined. Methods: This is a protocol for a qualitative systematic review of the factors that influence the motivation of individuals to participate in Voluntary First Response. A systematic search will be carried out on seven electronic databases. Qualitative studies, mixed-methods studies, and any other studies producing data relating to the review question will be eligible for inclusion.

Specifically, the results will inform the design and organisation of Voluntary First Response schemes, including their recruitment, training, and psychological support processes.

Estimation of incidence, prevalence and disease burden through routine insurance data is challenging because of under-diagnosis and under-treatment, particularly for early stage disease in health care systems where outpatient International Classification of Diseases (ICD) diagnoses are not collected. This poses the question of which criteria are commonly applied to identify COPD patients in claims datasets in the absence of ICD diagnoses, and which information can be used as a substitute. The aim of this systematic review is to summarize previously reported methodological approaches for the identification of COPD patients through routine data and to compile potential criteria for the identification of COPD patients if ICD codes are not available. METHODS: A systematic literature review was performed in Medline via PubMed and Google Scholar from January 2000 through October 2018, followed by a manual review of the included studies by at least two independent raters.

RESULTS: In total, the systematic search yielded 151 publications. After title and abstract screening, 38 publications were included into the systematic assessment. In these studies, the most frequently used (22/38) criteria set to identify COPD patients included ICD codes, hospitalization, and ambulatory visits. Only four out of 38 studies used methods other than ICD coding. In a significant proportion of studies, the age range of the target population (33/38) and hospitalization (30/38) were provided. Ambulatory data were included in 24, physician claims in 22, and pharmaceutical data in 18 studies. Only five studies used spirometry, two used surgery and one used oxygen therapy. CONCLUSIONS: A variety of different criteria is used for the identification of COPD from routine data. The most promising criteria set in data environments where ambulatory diagnosis codes are lacking is the consideration of additional illness-related information with special attention to pharmacotherapy data. Further health services research should focus on the application of more systematic internal and/or external validation approaches.','Gothe H and Rajsic S and Vukicevic D and Schoenfelder T and Jahn B and Geiger-Gritsch S and Brixner D and Popper N and Endel G and Siebert U','BMC health services research',NULL,'*Algorithms,Clinical Coding/*statistics & numerical data,Delivery of Health Care,Female,Humans,*International Classification of Diseases,Male,Middle Aged,Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive/*epidemiology'),(76,2,'29031933','29031933','Relevant models and elements of integrated care for multi-morbidity: Results of a scoping review.','BACKGROUND: In order to provide adequate care for the growing group of persons with multi-morbidity, innovative integrated care programmes are appearing. The aims of the current scoping review were to i) identify relevant models and elements of integrated care for multi-morbidity and ii) to subsequently identify which of these models and elements are applied in integrated care programmes for multi-morbidity. METHODS: A scoping review was conducted in the following scientific databases: Cochrane, Embase, PubMed, PsycInfo, Scopus, Sociological Abstracts, Social Services Abstracts, and Web of Science. A search strategy encompassing a) models, elements and programmes, b) integrated care, and c) multi-morbidity was used to identify both models and elements (aim 1) and implemented programmes of integrated care for multi-morbidity (aim 2). Data extraction was done by two independent reviewers. Besides general information on publications (e.g. publication year, geographical region, study design, and target group), data was extracted on models and elements that publications refer to, as well as which models and elements are applied in recently implemented programmes in the EU and US. RESULTS: In the review 11,641 articles were identified. After title and abstract screening, 272 articles remained. Full text screening resulted in the inclusion of 92 articles on models and elements, and 50 articles on programmes, of which 16 were unique programmes in the EU (n=11) and US (n=5). Wagner\'s Chronic Care Model (CCM) and the Guided Care Model (GCM) were most often referred to (CCM n=31; GCM n=6); the majority of the other models found were only referred to once (aim 1). Both the CCM and GCM focus on integrated care in general and do not explicitly focus on multi-morbidity. Identified elements of integrated care were clustered according to the WHO health system building blocks. Most elements pertained to \'service delivery\'. Across all components, the five elements referred to most often are person-centred care, holistic or needs assessment, integration and coordination of care services and/or professionals, collaboration, and self-management (aim 1). Most (n=10) of the 16 identified implemented programmes for multi-morbidity referred to the CCM (aim 2). Of all identified programmes, the elements most often included were self-management, comprehensive assessment, interdisciplinary care or collaboration, person-centred care and electronic information system (aim 2). CONCLUSION: Most models and elements found in the literature focus on integrated care in general and do not explicitly focus on multi-morbidity. In line with this, most programmes identified in the literature build on the CCM. A comprehensive framework that better accounts for the complexities resulting from multi-morbidity is needed.','Struckmann V and Leijten FRM and van Ginneken E and Kraus M and Reiss M and Spranger A and Boland MRS and Czypionka T and Busse R and Rutten-van Molken M','Health policy (Amsterdam, Netherlands)',NULL,'Chronic Disease,Delivery of Health Care, Integrated/*methods,Humans,Models, Theoretical,*Multimorbidity,Patient-Centered Care'),(77,2,'25883107','25883107','Morphologic and Demographic Predictors of Third Molar Agenesis: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.','We aimed to consolidate all available data on worldwide third molar agenesis frequencies, with a particular emphasis on exploring the factors leading authors to find contradictory results for the demographic and morphologic predictors of this anomaly.

Our subgroup analyses revealed that women are 14% more likely than men to have agenesis of >/=1 third molars and that maxillary agenesis was 36% more likely than mandibular agenesis in both sexes. Furthermore, we found that having agenesis of 1 or 2 molars was most common, while agenesis of 3 or 4 molars was least common. Finally, we found large differences among agenesis frequency depending on geographic region.

DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE(R), Cochrane CENTRAL, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Embase, from the beginning of each database to October 2011. Search strategies used combinations of controlled vocabulary (medical subject headings, keywords) and text words. Grey literature was identified. REVIEW METHODS: Three Key Questions (KQs) encompassing broad aspects of the analytic validity, clinical validity, and clinical utility of SNP-based panels were developed with the input of a Technical Expert Panel assembled by the Evidence-based Practice Center and approved by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. Standard systematic review methodology was applied, with eligibility criteria developed separately for each KQ. RESULTS: From 1,998 unique citations, 14 were retained for data abstraction and quality assessment following title and abstract screening and full text screening. All focused on clinical validity (KQ2), and evaluated 15 individual panels with two to 35 SNPs. All had poor discriminative ability for predicting risk of prostate cancer and/or distinguishing between aggressive and asymptomatic/latent disease. The risk of bias of the studies was determined to be moderate. None of the panels had been evaluated in routine clinical settings. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence on currently available SNP panels does not permit meaningful assessment of analytic validity. The limited evidence on clinical validity is insufficient to conclude that the panels assessed would perform adequately as screening or risk stratification tests. No evidence is available on the clinical utility of current panels.','Little J and Wilson B and Carter R and Walker K and Santaguida P and Tomiak E and Beyene J and Raina P','Evidence report/technology assessment',NULL,'Genetic Predisposition to Disease,Humans,Male,Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide,Prostatic Neoplasms/*genetics,Risk Assessment'),(79,2,'31102109','31102109','Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Pharmacist-Led Transitions of Care Services on the 30-Day All-Cause Readmission Rate of Patients with Congestive Heart Failure.','BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed to determine the cumulative effect of pharmacist-led transitions of care on the 30-day all-cause readmission rates of patients with congestive heart failure with the objective to isolate and assess the effect of pharmacy intervention to a condition-specific service. Previous studies that review pharmacist-led transitional care services involve multiple condition-specific services or a pharmacy service integrated into the healthcare team that presents complications in interpreting the independent effectiveness of component services by pharmacy professionals. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted using articles identified from MEDLINE, CINAHL, Web of Science, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and clinicaltrials.gov databases for studies on congestive heart failure readmission rates based on transitions of care pharmacist services using detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria. Abstracts were screened for outcome of interest and appropriate transitions of care program structure. Practice and patient characteristics were described and compared to identify current practice trends. A meta-analysis was then performed utilizing previously identified studies from systematic analysis that reported the required data to calculate the effect size. Evidence was reviewed and appraised according to the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for cohort studies. RESULTS: The database search produced 443 potential articles for inclusion. Six articles were identified for inclusion in the systematic review based on abstract screening. Of the six articles included in the systematic review, three studies met inclusion criteria for a meta-analysis. Two studies in the meta-analysis stated a significant reduction in the 30-day all-cause readmission rate for patients with congestive heart failure, while the third depicted a reduction in readmission that was found to be non-significant. The pooled effect of the included articles found that pharmacist-led transitions of care services for patients with congestive heart failure had an increased odds to have lower all-cause readmission rates of patients with congestive heart failure (odds ratio = 2.19, 95% confidence interval 1.50-3.20). Based on the meta-analysis of three studies, pharmacist-led transitions of care services significantly reduced the odds of 30-day all-cause readmission rates in patients with congestive heart failure compared with standard-of-care discharge protocols. CONCLUSION: Results of the meta-analysis demonstrate the capacity for pharmacist-led transitions of care programs to reduce 30-day all-cause readmission rates in patients with congestive heart failure compared with non-pharmacist discharge care. The financial implications of transitions of care pharmacist involvement have yet to be validated. In general, existing database search results highlight the lack of evidence detailing specific clinical outcomes of pharmacist-led transitions of care services in distinct chronic conditions.

Various prognostic tools have been developed to aid decision making by providing estimates of the probability of different outcomes. Such tools have been demonstrated to have better prognostic accuracy than clinical judgment alone. METHODS: A systematic review was undertaken to identify papers relating to the prediction of clinical outcomes (biochemical failure, metastasis, survival) in patients with prostate cancer who received radiation treatment, with the particular aim of identifying whether published tools are adequately developed, validated, and provide accurate predictions. PubMed and EMBASE were searched from July 2007. Title and abstract screening, full text review, and critical appraisal were conducted by two reviewers. A review protocol was published in advance of commencing literature searches. RESULTS: The search strategy resulted in 165 potential articles, of which 72 were selected for full text review and 47 ultimately included. These papers described 66 models which were newly developed and 31 which were external validations of already published predictive tools. The included studies represented a total of 60,457 patients, recruited between 1984 and 2009. Sixty five percent of models were not externally validated, 57% did not report accuracy and 31% included variables which are not readily accessible in existing datasets. Most models (72, 74%) related to external beam radiation therapy with the remainder relating to brachytherapy (alone or in combination with external beam radiation therapy). CONCLUSIONS: A large number of prognostic models (97) have been described in the recent literature, representing a rapid increase since previous reviews (17 papers, 1966-2007). Most models described were not validated and a third utilised variables which are not readily accessible in existing data collections. Where validation had occurred, it was often limited to data taken from single institutes in the US. While validated and accurate models are available to predict prostate cancer specific mortality following external beam radiation therapy, there is a scarcity of such tools relating to brachytherapy. This review provides an accessible catalogue of predictive tools for current use and which should be prioritised for future validation.','Raymond E and O\'Callaghan ME and Campbell J and Vincent AD and Beckmann K and Roder D and Evans S and McNeil J and Millar J and Zalcberg J and Borg M and Moretti K','Radiation oncology (London, England)',NULL,'Humans,Male,Nomograms,Prognosis,Prostatic Neoplasms/mortality/*radiotherapy,Treatment Outcome'),(81,2,'32166504','32166504','A Systematic Review of Cost-Effectiveness of Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter Inhibitors for Type 2 Diabetes.','PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) are the most recently approved class of drugs (since 2012) for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), but their economic merits have yet been fully confirmed.

These disorders, however, are consistently underdiagnosed and under-recognised which precludes effective treatment. Given that somatoform symptoms are associated with high impairment, healthcare costs and both physician and patient frustration, it is critical to improve early detection. The first step in improving patient care is to identify the current barriers which obstruct successful diagnosis to enable the design of targeted interventions. We aim to conduct a systematic review to identify the possible physician-, patient- and society-related factors and other practical constraints which may impede successful diagnosis. In the process, we will also be able to recognise the differences in methodological techniques, recommend potential avenues for future research and comment on the literature in this field as a whole. METHODS/DESIGN: We aim to conduct a systematic review of the relevant peer-reviewed literature published in English or German in the past 10 years in MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Additional studies may be identified from the reference lists of included studies. Title and abstract screening and data extraction from full text manuscripts will be conducted by two independent reviewers. Because we are including a combination of qualitative and quantitative studies, the review will provide a broad understanding of the current situation. Wherever possible, the method and reporting of the review will adhere to the guidelines outlined in the PRISMA statement and bias will be assessed using the Cochrane collaboration\'s recommendations. We envisage that data will be synthesised using a multilevel (qualitative and quantitative) approach which combines textual narrative and thematic analysis. Barriers will be categorised as modifiable or non-modifiable according to a conceptual framework. The review has been registered in an international registry of systematic reviews PROSPERO (CRD42013002540).

We also performed a secondary search by pearling bibliography of all full text articles obtained. Predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria were used for abstract screening by two independent observers. A total 46 cases met our inclusion criteria. These were included in the final analysis and data was pooled. RESULTS: Till date, 46 cases of GTF in MoP THR have been reported. The mean age at time of revision was 70.13 years (range 50 to 89 years). The mean time to revision surgery was 8.24 years (range 4.7 to 14 years). 91.4% cases were male. BMI was >/= 25 in 38/41 cases and >/= 30 in 21/41 cases. Pain (95.5%) and difficulty or inability to walk (97.7%) were the most common symptoms. A total of 19/44 cases described varying sounds like click, clunk, and pop before dislocation. Accolade TMZF/TMZF plus was the most common stem used in 34/46 cases. The stem neck angle was 127 degrees in 97% cases (32/33 cases). A positive neck offset of 4 mm or more was used in 91.1% cases (40/44 cases). The head size >/= 36 mm in approximately 90% cases. The head material was cobalt chromium in all 45 cases, where data was available. Among the intra-operative findings, the most common findings were metallosis (41/44), black or brow coloured synovial fluid (21/44), pseudotumour (19/44), synovial hypertrophy (18/44), damage to the abductor musculature (17/44), proximal femoral osteolysis (5/44 cases), and heterotrophic ossification (2/44 cases).

The aim of this study is to review the current literature to compare the key factors of EMS training and education development in different countries in order to provide a new curricula blueprint for the Taiwanese EMS training system. METHOD: The method follows Arksey and O\'Malley\'s six stages of scoping review. RESULTS: Five databases were searched for relevant articles: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database; Education Resources Information Center, and Google Scholar. The initial search of five databases produced 1,230 articles, of which title and abstract screening excluded 1,156 articles. The 74 remaining articles underwent a full-text screening process, which further reduced the number of articles to 22. Researching references and citations produced an additional 23 articles, national curriculum standards produced a further six documents, and one article derived from emergency medical technician (EMT) regulation in Taiwan. In total, 52 articles were included in the study, categorized by competency and standards, EMT education and learning environment, curriculum design, and teaching and learning method. CONCLUSION: This study reviewed international EMS training and education literature and documents to summarize the essential elements for developing an EMS education system: for example, core competencies and standards, education environment, curriculum design, and teaching and learning method. By connecting the essential elements for developing an EMS education system, a blueprint for the Taiwanese EMS education system can be identified. Analysis and study of the essential elements will provide educators with clear direction in developing the EMS education system in Taiwan.','Chang YT and Tsai KC and Williams B','Advances in medical education and practice',NULL,''),(86,2,'32706482','32706482','Cognitive-communication difficulties following traumatic brain injury sustained in older adulthood: a scoping review.','BACKGROUND: Older adults are a peak incidence group for traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, empirical evidence on TBI in older adults is often limited to extrapolated findings from studies involving younger adults. While cognitive-communication deficits are an established consequence of TBI with substantial impact on social outcome for younger adults, little is known about the nature of cognitive-communication changes experienced by older adults following a new-onset TBI. In order to inform evidence-based service delivery and support older adults who sustain TBI, it is important to understand how these difficulties manifest in older adults. AIMS: To review the empirical literature to determine the nature and breadth of research that has addressed the influence of older age on cognitive-communication outcomes following TBI sustained in older adulthood. METHODS & PROCEDURES: A scoping review framework was used. Five electronic databases (Medline, PsycINFO, Embase, CINAHL and Scopus) were searched to locate peer-reviewed studies addressing cognitive-communication following TBI sustained at >/= 55 years. Given the absence of dedicated investigations within the search yield, studies were included where at least 30% of participants were aged >/= 55 years at injury, and age was a stated focus of the investigation. OUTCOMES & RESULTS: A total of 2468 unique records were identified and reduced to 225 after title and abstract screening. Full-text review revealed only three studies that met the criteria. Collectively these studies included adults aged 55-93 years at injury. Two studies focused on age as a predictor for acute cognitive-communication difficulty, and one on the impact of age on facial emotion recognition in the chronic stages of injury. None of the studies had a dedicated focus on cognitive-communication outcomes for older adults who sustained a TBI within the defined period of older adulthood. CONCLUSIONS & IMPLICATIONS: This scoping review produced limited results and insufficient evidence to inform rehabilitation for older adults. Indeed, very little is known about cognitive-communication outcomes for older adults who sustain a TBI. This review highlights the need, in the context of an ageing population, for research within this area to be prioritized. What this paper adds What is already known on the subject Empirical evidence to support the management of post-TBI cognitive-communication difficulties in adults predominantly stems from studies with young adults. However, the broader TBI literature suggests that outcome for older adults requires specific consideration due to its distinct nature and occurrence during a stage of life when there is the potential for subtle change to the processes of cognition and communication as part of typical ageing. What this paper adds to existing knowledge This scoping review identifies that research related to cognitive-communication outcomes for older adults who have sustained a TBI is very much in its infancy. Overarching statements about post-TBI cognitive-communication outcomes for older adults cannot be drawn, nor can it be determined if outcomes for older adults differ from younger adults. What are the potential or actual clinical implications of this work? The lack of research in this area means that tangible guidance cannot be provided to clinicians working with older adults following TBI to support evidence-based practice for cognitive-communication. This scoping review strongly supports the need for further research in this area.','Shorland J and Douglas J and O\'Halloran R','International journal of language & communication disorders',NULL,''),(87,2,'32164187','32164187','Impact of Infant and Young Child Feeding (IYCF) Nutrition Interventions on Breastfeeding Practices, Growth and Mortality in Low- and Middle-Income Countries: Systematic Review.','Undernutrition is associated with 45% of total infant deaths, totalling 2.7 million globally per year.

Abstract screening produced 97 articles to be read in entirety, of which 10 articles studying 1963 implants met all prospective inclusion criteria for analysis. Overall survivorship of all implants was 93.0% (95% confidence interval, 85.2-96.9) using a random effect model. There was significant heterogeneity between the studies (Q=131.504).

METHODS: Search procedure, formal appraisal: Systematic search using literature databases and English-/German-language databases, published between 1990 and 1999. Abstract screening of the search results according to the inclusion criteria (n = 132 of a total of 548 hits). Systematic guideline evaluation using checklist with predefined criteria. APPRAISAL OF GUIDELINES\' CONTENTS: Peer review of guidelines with the following inclusion criteria: hypertension--general, German and English language, published later than 1994, original or primary guideline or update, issued for nationwide use. Peer review was performed by a multidisciplinary focus group of EBM experts (primary and secondary care physicians, clinical pharmacologist, clinical epidemiologist). None of these was involved in hypertension guideline development during the review period. DOCUMENTATION OF CRITICAL APPRAISAL RESULTS: Systematic documentation of methodological appraisal and peer review results using a structured abstract form. The focus group wrote a final report (clearing report) including methodological abstracts for each guideline, essential topics for a future German hypertension guideline based on examples from the appraised guidelines, comments and recommendations for health care policy markers in Germany. RESULTS: 11 out of 132 guidelines were in accordance with the formal minimal standard with a wide range range within the following domains: \"description of the development process\", \"declaration of authors\' independence\", \"explicit link between recommendations and the supporting evidence\", \"management options\", \"tools for implementation\". None of the guidelines identified all the key identified by the focus group, such as: (1) definition of hypertension--epidemiology--health care problems--intended guideline users/goals, (2) blood pressure measurement, (3) medical history and physical examination, (4) case-finding/screening, (5) indications for referral, (6) risk-stratification, (7) diagnostic procedures, (8) therapeutic goals/indications for therapy, (9) nonpharmacological measures, (10), pharmacotherapy, (11) follow-up/patient education/motivation/compliance, (12) comorbidity, hypertension in childhood/elderly, pregnancy, (13) primary prevention, (14) quality assurance/quality management, (15) dissemination/implementation, (16) open questions/challenges for the future. SUMMARY POINTS: To improve the quality of hypertension management in Germany, the expert panel suggested to develop a national evidence-based guideline. This should follow internationally agreed criteria and procedures. The experts identified and reviewed 11 out of 132 hypertension, which might make useful contributions for a future German Hypertension guideline. The expert group identified 16 key topics for a national hypertension guideline.','Donner-Banzhoff N and Echterhoff HH and Hense HW and Kunz R and Sawicki P and Thurmann P and Jonitz G and Ollenschlager G','Zeitschrift fur arztliche Fortbildung und Qualitatssicherung',NULL,'Comorbidity,Female,Germany,Guidelines as Topic,Humans,Hypertension/*prevention & control/*therapy,Peer Review,Pregnancy,Pregnancy Complications, Cardiovascular/prevention & control/therapy,Quality Assurance, Health Care'),(91,2,'29333999','29333999','Consequences of Elder Abuse and Neglect: A Systematic Review of Observational Studies.','This article presents the results of a systematic review of the consequences of elder abuse and neglect (EAN). A systematic search was conducted in seven electronic databases and three sources of gray literature up to January 8, 2016, supplemented by scanning of citation lists in relevant articles and contact with field experts. All observational studies investigating elder abuse as a risk factor for adverse health outcomes, mortality, and health-care utilization were included. Of 517 articles initially captured, 19 articles met our inclusion criteria and were analyzed. Two reviewers independently performed abstract screening, full-texts appraisal, and quality assessment using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Across 19 studies, methodological heterogeneity was a prominent feature; seven definitions of EAN and nine measurement tools for abuse were employed. Summary of results reveals a wide range of EAN outcomes, from premature mortality to increased health-care consumption and various forms of physical and psychological symptoms. Higher risks of mortality emerged as the most credible outcome, while the majority of morbidity outcomes originated from cross-sectional studies. Our findings suggest that there is an underrepresentation of older adults from non-Western populations and developing countries, and there is a need for more population-based prospective studies in middle- and low-income regions. Evidence gathered from this review is crucial in upgrading current practices, formulating policies, and shaping the future direction of research.','Yunus RM and Hairi NN and Choo WY','Trauma, violence & abuse',NULL,'Aged,Aged, 80 and over,*Crime Victims,Cross-Sectional Studies,*Elder Abuse/mortality/psychology/therapy,Female,*Health Status,Humans,Male,Observational Studies as Topic,Prospective Studies,Risk Factors,Sex Distribution'),(92,2,'32377828','32377828','Treatment options and long-term outcomes in pediatric spinal cord vascular malformations: a case report and review of the literature.','A 16-month-old female was admitted for prolonged fever, gait ataxia, and neurogenic bowel and bladder. Neurological exam was significant for decreased sensory and motor functions in bilateral lower extremities. Initial MRI showed a thoracic spine hematoma and diagnostic angiogram revealed a large AVM and aneurysm. The patient underwent surgical resection of the hematoma and AVM, as well as clipping and later endovascular coiling of the aneurysm. Due to significant hemorrhage perioperatively, she developed spastic paraplegia improved by baclofen and onabotulinumtoxin A injections. The aims of this paper were to conduct a systematic review of the literature on pediatric spinal cord vascular malformations and analyze trends in treatment options and long-term neurological outcomes. PubMed searches were conducted using keywords \"pediatric spinal vascular malformation\" and \"pediatric spinal AVM\", yielding 34 results after abstract screening and cross-reference. Endovascular embolization was determined to have better long-term outcomes, with 10/19 (52.6%) patients with postoperative complications associated with open vascular surgeries. Open versus endovascular surgical decisions can be difficult with unique spinal AVM pathologies in pediatric patients. Important considerations such as size, location, neurological deficits, and risk of rupture are important factors to consider in treating these patients. We recommend endovascular treatment as a first-line approach due to lower risk of hemorrhage and postoperative deficits.','Zhang HJ and Silva N and Solli E and Ayala AC and Tomycz L and Christie C and Mazzola CA','Child\'s nervous system : ChNS : official journal of the International Society for Pediatric Neurosurgery',NULL,''),(93,2,'29230842','29230842','Use of Ultrasound Contrast Agents in Relation to Percutaneous Interventional Procedures: A Systematic Review and Pictorial Essay.','The aim of this article is to provide an inventory of the use of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) in relation to percutaneous interventional procedures.

Suboptimal adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and poor viral suppression are reported among ALHIV which may in turn compromise the gains achieved so far. The evidence on whether knowing one\'s own human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status and self-disclosure to others benefit adherence to ART or not is inconclusive. This review aims to estimate the association between knowing one\'s HIV status and self-disclosure on adherence to ART among ALHIV in SSA. METHODS: Comprehensive search strings will be used to identify relevant observational studies published in English up to May 2020 in major databases: Excerpta Medica database (EMBASE), PubMed, and Ovid/MEDLINE. To access African studies and also to freely access subscription-based articles, the African Index Medicus (AIM) and the WHO HINARI databases will be searched. The AfroLib database will be searched to access the gray literature of African studies. We will use the COVIDENCE software for title/abstract screening, full-text screening, quality assessment, and data extraction. Two authors will independently screen retrieved articles, and a third author authorized to resolve conflicts will handle disagreements. The Joanna Briggs Institute\'s (JBI) critical appraisal tools will be used to assess study quality. Appropriate statistical tests will be conducted to quantify the between studies heterogeneity and for the assessment of publication bias. We will check individual study influence analysis and also do subgroup analysis. The STATA version 14.2 will be used for statistical analysis. DISCUSSION: A high-level adherence to ART is required to achieve adequate viral suppression and improve quality of life. Consequently, the evidence on how adherence to ART differs with knowledge of one\'s own HIV status and self-disclosure may help guide interventions aimed at improving adherence to ART.','Mengesha MM and Ajema D and Teshome A and Tura AK','Systematic reviews',NULL,''),(95,2,'28406572','28406572','Review article: Workplace violence in the emergency department: A systematic review and meta analysis.','Patient or visitor perpetrated workplace violence (WPV) has been reported to be a common occurrence within the ED. No universal definition of violence or recording of such events exists. In addition ED staff are often reluctant to report violent incidents. The true incidence of WPV is therefore unclear. This systematic review aimed to quantify WPV in EDs. The association of WPV to drug and alcohol exposure was explored. The databases MEDLINE, Embase, PsycInfo and the Cochrane Library were searched from their commencement to 10 March 2016. MeSH terms and text words for ED, violence and aggression were combined. A meta-analysis was conducted on the primary outcome variable-proportion of violent patients among total ED presentations. A secondary meta-analysis used studies reporting on proportion of drug and alcohol affected patients occurring within the violent population. The search yielded a total of 8720 records. A total of 7235 were unique and underwent abstract screening. A total of 22 studies were deemed relevant according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. Retrospective study design predominated, analysing mainly security records and incident reports. The rates of violence from individual studies ranged from 1 incident to 172 incidents per 10 000 presentations. The pooled incidence suggests there are 36 violent patients for every 10 000 presentations to the ED (95% confidence interval 0.0030-0.0043). WPV in the ED was commonly reported. There is wide heterogeneity across the study methodology, definitions and rates.

DESIGN: A systematic review using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses: the PRISMA Statement. DATA SOURCES: Pubmed, Medline (OVID), CINAHL (EBSCOHost), EBM Reviews (OVID) and PsychINFO (OVID) were searched between January 2004 and September 2012 by using keywords as dementia, Alzheimer, feed(ing), eat(ing), mealtime(s), oral intake, nutrition, intervention, experimental, quasi-experimental and any matched terms. Other sources included Google Scholar and relevant bibliographies. REVIEW METHODS: Eligibility criteria were established by defining the population, intervention, comparator, outcomes, timing and setting of interest. Studies were reviewed by title and abstract screening, and full-text assessing for eligibility. Data were abstracted from eligible studies using a self-made structured tool. Eligible studies were classified by intervention, accessed for quality using the Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies, and graded for evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation Working Group criteria. RESULTS: Twenty-two intervention studies (9 RCTs), including a total of 2082 older adults with dementia and 95 professionals from more than 85 long-term care facilities, were selected, and classified into five types: nutritional supplements, training/education programs, environment/routine modification, feeding assistance and mixed interventions. Eight studies were strong, eleven moderate and three weak in quality. Limitations of body of research included lack of randomization and/or control group, small sample size without power analysis, lack of theory-based interventions and blinding, inadequate statistical analysis and plausible confounding bias. \"Nutritional supplements\" showed moderate evidence to increase food intake, body weight and BMI. \"Training/education programs\" demonstrated moderate evidence to increase eating time and decrease feeding difficulty. Both \"training/education programs\" and \"feeding assistance\" were insufficient to increase food intake. \"Environment/routine modification\" indicated low evidence to increase food intake, and insufficient to decrease agitation. Evidence was sparse on nutritional status, eating ability, behavior disturbance, behavioral and cognitive function, or level of dependence.

Current evidence is based on a body of research with moderate quality and existing limitations, and needs to be further explored with more rigorous studies.','Liu W and Cheon J and Thomas SA','International journal of nursing studies',NULL,'Aged,Dementia/*physiopathology,*Eating,Humans'),(97,2,'32855628','32855628','The Effect of Genetically Modified Food on Infertility Indices: A Systematic Review Study.','Background and Objectives. With the increase in the growth of genetically modified (GM) crops, concerns as to the adverse effects of GM crops have risen in the community. The present systematic review seeks to assess the GM plants\' potential impacts on the sperm parameters, including sperm head, sperm motility, sperm abnormality, and fertility index. Materials and Methods. A structured literature search was independently performed by three authors on Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, and Embase in January 2019. A total of 1467 publications were obtained by the search strategy after eliminating the duplicates. Moreover, the review only included articles written in English language. Other pertinent peer-reviewed publications were chosen (\"snowballing\") from the reference lists in the selected publications. To assess the GM crop effects on infertility, experimental studies designed with the control group were selected. On the basis of abstract screening and full-text reviewing, 39 relevant publications were selected, seven of which were used in our review. To access the quality of articles, we used the Cochrane checklist. The collected articles were scored independently by three authors, and the publications with the eligibility criteria were included in our review. No article was excluded due to quality assessment. Results and Conclusion. Our findings indicated that GM products had no adverse effects on infertility indices such as the sperm head, sperm motility, sperm abnormality, and fertility indices. Long-term research still seems to be strongly necessary to ensure that the use of GM plants does not cause any harm to consumers, especially in infertility area.','Keshani P and Sharifi MH and Heydari MR and Joulaei H','TheScientificWorldJournal',NULL,''),(98,2,'32609536','32609536','Engagement in Nonbiomedical Practices for Fertility Enhancement: A Scoping Review.','Objectives: This scoping review aims to (1) describe the scope and coverage of the body of literature on nonbiomedical practices used for enhancing fertility, (2) summarize and map the existing evidence on the extent and types of nonbiomedical practices used, and (3) examine how the research on this topic has been conducted with particular attention paid to how participants are asked about their use of nonbiomedical practices for fertility enhancement. Design: We conducted a scoping review by which four databases were searched (PubMed, Psychinfo, Socindex, and CINHAL). Articles were screened for inclusion by two researchers through a title and abstract screening followed by a full-text screening. Data were extracted from included articles and results summarized and compared across studies and regions. Results: A total of 32 studies were identified from 16 countries in five regions of the world. The majority of studies were clinic-based, primarily recruiting participants from fertility clinics in urban and suburban areas. More than half of the studies included only women, a few studies included only men, and the remainder of studies included both men and women. Most quantitative studies reported the prevalence of nonbiomedical practice use, which ranged from 8% to 83%; however, there was variation across studies regarding the time frame for which these percentages were derived. Few studies reported on other measures of the extent of use such as duration or frequency. A variety of nonbiomedical practices were identified with biologically based treatments, particularly herbal medicine use, being the most common followed by religious and spiritual interventions. Regional differences were identified. Variation in the wording and format of the question(s) used in survey instruments asking participants about their use of nonbiomedical practices exists and may impact participants\' reporting of use. Conclusions: Infertility affects millions of individuals worldwide often with severe social, emotional, and financial consequences. To enhance fertility and, in some cases, overcome infertility, many individuals and couples are engaging in a variety of nonbiomedical practices. This scoping review describes the scope and nature of the existing literature on the use of nonbiomedical practices for fertility enhancement and highlights important gaps and limitations in the conduct of this research. A more comprehensive and inclusive investigation of nonbiomedical practices for enhancing fertility is needed to improve our understanding of how individuals and couples are managing infertility, identify educational and counseling needs, and to improve research related to effectiveness and safety of nonbiomedical practices.','Cox CM and Johnson CL','Journal of alternative and complementary medicine (New York, N.Y.)',NULL,''),(99,2,'32139084','32139084','Examining the Neuropsychiatric Sequelae Postsurgical Resection of Adult Brain Tumors Through a Scoping Review.','BACKGROUND: Improving brain tumor survival rates have drawn increasing focus on neuropsychiatric and psychological outcomes. OBJECTIVE: This review characterizes the literature on neuropsychiatric sequelae after neurosurgical resection of adult brain tumors. METHODS: Using a scoping method, we reviewed articles describing patients with adult brain tumor who underwent partial or total brain resection and examined major neuropsychiatric domains after intervention. RESULTS: The initial search yielded 9903 articles. After duplicate removal, abstract screening, review, and hand searching, 81 articles were found: 63 empirical and 18 nonempirical. Most articles centered on survivorship within the first year. Cognition was most widely studied with a transient worsening during the first month and usually recovery or improvement thereafter. Depression increased in frequency during survivorship and was associated with frontotemporal location, time to survival, quality of life, cognitive and physical parameters, and functional status. Anxiety, independent of depression, related to tumor histology and grading and had a weaker association with cognition and quality of life. Obsessive-compulsive symptoms, psychosis, mania, and delirium received little attention. Most studies did not include preoperative neuropsychiatric assessment, and treatment was poorly addressed. CONCLUSION: This review highlights key gaps, including preoperative and postoperative neuropsychiatric assessment and a short follow-up.

Unfortunately, it is increasingly challenging for small teams to complete SR procedures in a reasonable time period, given the exponential rise in the volume of primary literature. Crowdsourcing has been postulated as a potential solution. OBJECTIVE: The feasibility objective of this study was to determine whether a crowd would be willing to perform and complete abstract and full text screening. The validation objective was to assess the quality of the crowd\'s work, including retention of eligible citations (sensitivity) and work performed for the investigative team, defined as the percentage of citations excluded by the crowd. METHODS: We performed a prospective study evaluating crowdsourcing essential components of an SR, including abstract screening, document retrieval, and full text assessment. Using CrowdScreenSR citation screening software, 2323 articles from 6 SRs were available to an online crowd. Citations excluded by less than or equal to 75% of the crowd were moved forward for full text assessment. For the validation component, performance of the crowd was compared with citation review through the accepted, gold standard, trained expert approach. RESULTS: Of 312 potential crowd members, 117 (37.5%) commenced abstract screening and 71 (22.8%) completed the minimum requirement of 50 citation assessments. The majority of participants were undergraduate or medical students (192/312, 61.5%). The crowd screened 16,988 abstracts (median: 8 per citation; interquartile range [IQR] 7-8), and all citations achieved the minimum of 4 assessments after a median of 42 days (IQR 26-67). Crowd members retrieved 83.5% (774/927) of the articles that progressed to the full text phase. A total of 7604 full text assessments were completed (median: 7 per citation; IQR 3-11). Citations from all but 1 review achieved the minimum of 4 assessments after a median of 36 days (IQR 24-70), with 1 review remaining incomplete after 3 months. When complete crowd member agreement at both levels was required for exclusion, sensitivity was 100% (95% CI 97.9-100) and work performed was calculated at 68.3% (95% CI 66.4-70.1). Using the predefined alternative 75% exclusion threshold, sensitivity remained 100% and work performed increased to 72.9% (95% CI 71.0-74.6; P<.001). Finally, when a simple majority threshold was considered, sensitivity decreased marginally to 98.9% (95% CI 96.0-99.7; P=.25) and work performed increased substantially to 80.4% (95% CI 78.7-82.0; P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Crowdsourcing of citation screening for SRs is feasible and has reasonable sensitivity and specificity. By expediting the screening process, crowdsourcing could permit the investigative team to focus on more complex SR tasks. Future directions should focus on developing a user-friendly online platform that allows research teams to crowdsource their reviews.','Nama N and Sampson M and Barrowman N and Sandarage R and Menon K and Macartney G and Murto K and Vaccani JP and Katz S and Zemek R and Nasr A and McNally JD','Journal of medical Internet research',NULL,'Crowdsourcing/*methods,Humans,Mass Screening/*methods,Research Design/*standards,Validation Studies as Topic'),(101,2,'31345279','31345279','Clinical Relevance of Home Monitoring of Vital Signs and Blood Glucose Levels: A Narrative Review.','OBJECTIVES: We sought to assess the presence and reporting quality of peer-reviewed literature concerning the accuracy, precision, and reliability of home monitoring technologies for vital signs and glucose determinations in older adult populations.

A systematic review.','OBJECTIVES: Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) causes recurrent episodes of fever and painful serositis. It has been suggested that FMF can cause recurrent aseptic meningitis (RAM). Due to the rarity of both diseases, this claim cannot be assessed with epidemiological methods. We therefore decided to perform a systematic review of the literature to assess the number and validity of published case reports. METHODS: Medline, Embase, Pascal, Web of Science and the proceedings of relevant conferences were searched. Two independent investigators selected reports asserting RAM in FMF patients, abstracted data and rated the strength of evidence with a custom tool designed to assess: (a) the diagnosis of FMF; (b) the diagnosis of RAM; and (c) the link between FMF and RAM. A causal link was supported by (i) evidence of inflammation and/or clinical FMF features during episodes of RAM; (ii) effectiveness of colchicine to prevent further bouts of meningitis; and (iii) the exclusion of other causes of RAM. RESULTS: Among 944 retrieved references, 917 were rejected by title and abstract screening and 15 after full text review. The strength of evidence of 12 alleged cases of RAM due to FMF was assessed. FMF was unsupported in 4 cases and RAM in 3 further cases. Four of the 5 remaining cases did not provide adequate evidence to support a causal relationship between FMF and RAM. CONCLUSIONS: The possibility of RAM due to FMF is poorly supported by a single fairly documented case report that does not, however, meet current diagnostic standards.','Capron J and Grateau G and Steichen O','Clinical and experimental rheumatology',NULL,'Colchicine/therapeutic use,Evidence-Based Medicine,Familial Mediterranean Fever/*complications/diagnosis/drug therapy/immunology,Humans,Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use,Meningitis, Aseptic/diagnosis/drug therapy/*etiology/immunology,Recurrence,Risk Factors,Treatment Outcome'),(103,2,'29895310','29895310','Developing a measure of polypharmacy appropriateness in primary care: systematic review and expert consensus study.','BACKGROUND: Polypharmacy is an increasing challenge for primary care. Although sometimes clinically justified, polypharmacy can be inappropriate, leading to undesirable outcomes. Optimising care for polypharmacy necessitates effective targeting and monitoring of interventions. This requires a valid, reliable measure of polypharmacy, relevant for all patients, that considers clinical appropriateness and generic prescribing issues applicable across all medications. Whilst there are several existing measures of potentially inappropriate prescribing, these are not specifically designed with polypharmacy in mind, can require extensive clinical input to complete, and often cover a limited number of drugs. The aim of this study was to identify what experts consider to be the key elements of a measure of prescribing appropriateness in the context of polypharmacy. METHODS: Firstly, we conducted a systematic review to identify generic (not drug specific) prescribing indicators relevant to polypharmacy appropriateness. Indicators were subject to content analysis to enable categorisation. Secondly, we convened a panel of 10 clinical experts to review the identified indicators and assess their relative clinical importance. For each indicator category, a brief evidence summary was developed, based on relevant clinical and indicator literature, clinical guidance, and opinions obtained from a separate patient discussion panel. A two-stage RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method was used to reach consensus amongst the panel on a core set of indicators of polypharmacy appropriateness. RESULTS: We identified 20,879 papers for title/abstract screening, obtaining 273 full papers. We extracted 189 generic indicators, and presented 160 to the panel grouped into 18 classifications (e.g. adherence, dosage, clinical efficacy). After two stages, during which the panel introduced 18 additional indicators, there was consensus that 134 indicators were of clinical importance. Following the application of decision rules and further panel consultation, 12 indicators were placed into the final selection. Panel members particularly valued indicators concerned with adverse drug reactions, contraindications, drug-drug interactions, and the conduct of medication reviews. CONCLUSIONS: We have identified a set of 12 indicators of clinical importance considered relevant to polypharmacy appropriateness. Use of these indicators in clinical practice and informatics systems is dependent on their operationalisation and their utility (e.g. risk stratification, targeting and monitoring polypharmacy interventions) requires subsequent evaluation.

Through the digital and social media ecosystem, health scientists play a growing role in public science communication (SC). OBJECTIVE: This review aimed to (1) synthesize the literature on SC initiated by health scientists targeting the public in the digital and social media ecosystem and (2) describe the SC strategies and communication channels used. METHODS: This scoping review was based on the Joanna Briggs Institute Methodological Framework. A systematic search was performed in 6 databases (January 2000 to April 2018). Title and abstract screening, full-text review, data charting, and critical appraisal were performed independently by two review authors. Data regarding included studies and communication channels were synthesized descriptively. A typology of SC strategies was developed using a qualitative and inductive method of data synthesis. RESULTS: Among 960 unique publications identified, 18 met inclusion criteria. A third of publications scored good quality (6/18, 33%), half scored moderate quality (9/18, 50%), and less than a fifth scored low quality (3/18, 16%). Overall, 75 SC strategies used by health scientists were identified. These were grouped into 9 types: content, credibility, engagement, intention, linguistics, planification, presentation, social exchange, and statistics. A total of 5 types of communication channels were identified: social networking platforms (eg, Twitter), content-sharing platforms (eg, YouTube), digital research communities (eg, ResearchGate), personal blogs and websites (eg, WordPress), and social news aggregation and discussion platforms (eg, Reddit). CONCLUSIONS: Evidence suggests that multiple types of SC strategies and communication channels are used by health scientists concurrently. Few empirical studies have been conducted on SC by health scientists in the digital and social media ecosystem.

METHODS: A systematic review was conducted of studies published in MEDLINE and Cochrane Trials before May 2012. The search strategy was constructed to identify articles indexed with \"comorbidity\" or a related term or by a given condition and one or more additional specified comorbid conditions. The search yielded 3252 articles, of which 37 passed the title/abstract screening process, and 22 were included after full-text review. An additional 23 articles were identified by screening the reference lists for included articles. Information was extracted on study design; population; therapy; comparison groups; outcome(s); main findings. FINDINGS: Indexing of articles was inconsistent, with no term for \"multimorbidity,\" and rare use of \"comorbidity\". Only one article examined the effects of comorbidity per se, finding no benefit of tight control of DM among persons with high comorbidity, defined using a comorbidity index. The remainder examined pairs of conditions, the majority of which were post-hoc analyses of randomized controlled trials and which found no difference in outcomes according to whether a comorbid condition was present. Several demonstrated no difference or an increased risk of adverse outcome among persons with DM and tight control of HTN as compared to usual control. Several demonstrated lack of benefit of statins among persons with end-stage renal disease. CONCLUSIONS: There is limited evidence regarding the effects of multiple comorbidities on treatment outcomes. The majority of studies demonstrated no effect of a single comorbid condition on outcomes. Additional studies examining a broad range of comorbidity are required, along with clear and consistent indexing to allow for improved synthesis of the evidence.','Fried TR and O\'Leary J and Towle V and Goldstein MK and Trentelange M and Martin DK','PloS one',NULL,'Cardiovascular Diseases/epidemiology/therapy,Chronic Disease/*epidemiology/*therapy,Comorbidity,Humans,Kidney Failure, Chronic/epidemiology/therapy,Risk,Treatment Outcome'),(107,2,'29577629','29577629','Efficacy and safety of intravitreal anti-tumour necrosis factor drugs in adults with non-infectious uveitis - a systematic review.','Anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) drugs have been extensively used in non-infectious uveitis (NIU), when corticosteroids or conventional immunosuppressive drugs cannot adequately control inflammation or intolerable side-effects occur. However, systemic anti-TNF therapies are also associated with a myriad of side-effects. Therefore, intravitreal administration of anti-TNF biologics has been employed to minimize patient morbidity and systemic adverse effects, while maintaining therapeutic effectivity. We undertook a systematic review to determine evidence of efficacy and safety of intravitreal administration of anti-TNF drugs in adults with NIU. We conducted this systematic review according to the PRISMA guidelines. The protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42016041946). We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE and EMBASE, from inception to April 2017, as well as clinical trial registries and grey literature. The qualitative analysis included all studies of adult patients with a diagnosis of NIU and who received intravitreal anti-TNF drugs with a 4-week minimum follow-up. A total of 4840 references were considered for title and abstract screening. Seven full texts were screened, and five studies were considered for analysis. All studies were open-label, single-centre, prospective, non-randomized, interventional case series with a follow-up between 4 and 26 weeks, employing either adalimumab in two studies and infliximab in three. Three studies showed a treatment effect of anti-TNF intravitreal injections, while one study revealed short-term improvement and one study revealed no efficacy of anti-TNF intravitreal therapy. None of the studies reported ocular adverse effects but only two studies included electrophysiological assessment in the safety analysis and no study assessed systemic human anti-drug antibodies. The available evidence is not sufficiently robust to conclude about the clinical effectivity of intravitreal anti-TNF in NIU and so no recommendation can be made. In conclusion, intravitreal injection of anti-TNF antibodies remains a possible treatment option to be explored through robust clinical investigation.','Leal I and Rodrigues FB and Sousa DC and Romao VC and Duarte GS and Carreno E and Dick AD and Marques-Neves C and Costa J and Fonseca JE','Acta ophthalmologica',NULL,'Adult,Humans,Immunosuppressive Agents/*administration & dosage,Intravitreal Injections,Treatment Outcome,Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*antagonists & inhibitors,Uveitis/*drug therapy'),(108,2,'30813904','30813904','Are big data analytics helpful in caring for multimorbid patients in general practice? - A scoping review.','BACKGROUND: The treatment of multimorbid patients is one crucial task in general practice as multimorbidity is highly prevalent in this setting. However, there is little evidence how to treat these patients and consequently there are but a few guidelines that focus primarily on multimorbidity. Big data analytics are defined as a method that obtains results for high volume data with high variety generated at high velocity. Yet, the explanatory power of these results is not completely understood. Nevertheless, addressing multimorbidity as a complex condition might be a promising field for big data analytics. The aim of this scoping review was to evaluate whether applying big data analytics on patient data does already contribute to the treatment of multimorbid patients in general practice. METHODS: In January 2018, a review searching the databases PubMed, The Cochrane Library, and Web of Science, using defined search terms for \"big data analytics\" and \"multimorbidity\", supplemented by a search of grey literature with Google Scholar, was conducted. Studies were not filtered by type of study, publication year or language. Validity of studies was evaluated independently by two researchers. RESULTS: In total, 2392 records were identified for screening. After title and abstract screening, six articles were included in the full-text analysis. Of those articles, one reported on a model generated with big data techniques to help caring for one group of multimorbid patients. The other five articles dealt with the analysis of multimorbidity clusters. No article defined big data analytics explicitly. CONCLUSIONS: Although the usage of the phrase \"Big Data\" is growing rapidly, there is nearly no practical use case for big data analysis techniques in the treatment of multimorbidity in general practice yet. Furthermore, in publications addressing big data analytics, the term is rarely defined. However, possible models and algorithms to address multimorbidity in the future are already published.','Waschkau A and Wilfling D and Steinhauser J','BMC family practice',NULL,'*Big Data,General Practice,Humans,*Medical Informatics,Multimorbidity,Multiple Chronic Conditions/*therapy'),(109,2,'24456552','24456552','An exploration of the concept of connect.','AIM: The purpose is to explore the concept of connect in multiple disciplines for further development of knowledge and theories in nursing and to establish a clear understanding of this construct. BACKGROUND: Connect has meanings rooted in the discipline of business, technology, and transportation which influence how the term is defined in nursing. Several definitions have been established that demonstrate the concepts of connect in other disciplines. DESIGN: A concept exploration design was used for the identification and explication of the term connect to describe, explain, and predict this interprofessional phenomenon. REVIEW METHODS: The databases CINAHL, MEDLINE, PRO-Quest, and EBSCO were searched for articles through title and abstract screening using connect, connectedness, and connectivity. RESULTS: Three specific components were identified in the exploration: (a) respect, (b) trust, and (c) mutuality. Current literature validated the need for an empirical concept analysis. CONCLUSIONS: This concept exploration provides the first step in understanding the context and meaning of connect in nursing profession. By determining if connections exist and quantifying the level of connections, a level of congruency between the nurse and the patient can be established to determine the best plan of care and goals.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using scoping review methodology for the screening and selection of valid articles, the steps of this review were the following: first, to pose a research question; second, to identify relevant studies; third, to select and retrieve the studies; fourth, to chart the critical data, and finally, to collate, summarise, and report the results from the included articles. Relevant articles published over a 25-year period, up to July 31, 2017, were identified and retrieved from four Internet databases: PubMed; EMBASE/Ovid; Ebsco/Dentistry & Oral Science Source, and the Cochrane Collaboration Library. RESULTS: By title and abstract screening and after removing duplicates, four articles were finally included in the scoping review. According to the extracted data, the following are the most important clinical issues to be considered: (1) the disease can appear as a consequence of a dental treatment, such as those indicated for oral infectious processes; (2) children with HSPG are highly susceptible to dental caries and apical periodontitis, and (3) in affected children, oral infectious foci must be exhaustively eradicated in order to avoid the dissemination of the infection.

METHODS: We subjected 11 systematic reviews and six rapid reviews to four retrospective screening simulations (automated and semi-automated approaches to single-reviewer and dual independent screening) in Abstrackr, a freely-available machine learning software. We calculated the proportion missed, workload savings, and time savings compared to single-reviewer and dual independent screening by human reviewers. We performed cited reference searches to determine if missed studies would be identified via reference list scanning. RESULTS: For systematic reviews, the semi-automated, dual independent screening approach provided the best balance of time savings (median (range) 20 (3-82) hours) and reliability (median (range) proportion missed records, 1 (0-14)%). The cited references search identified 59% (n = 10/17) of the records missed. For the rapid reviews, the fully and semi-automated approaches saved time (median (range) 9 (2-18) hours and 3 (1-10) hours, respectively), but less so than for the systematic reviews. The median (range) proportion missed records for both approaches was 6 (0-22)%. CONCLUSION: Using Abstrackr to assist one of two reviewers in systematic reviews saves time with little risk of missing relevant records. Many missed records would be identified via other means.','Gates A and Gates M and Sebastianski M and Guitard S and Elliott SA and Hartling L','BMC medical research methodology',NULL,''),(113,2,'30246649','30246649','The Associations of Dietary Acid Load with Insulin Resistance and Type 2 Diabetes: A Systematic Review of Existing Human Studies.','BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes is a multifactorial disorder influenced by both genetic and environmental factors and is rising dramatically throughout the world.

METHODS: A systematic search of the literature was performed to identify studies evaluating the use of CBCT imaging in endodontics. The identified studies were subjected to strict inclusion criteria followed by an analysis using a hierarchical model of efficacy (model) designed for appraisal of the literature on the levels of efficacy of a diagnostic imaging modality. RESULTS: Initially, 485 possible relevant articles were identified. After title and abstract screening and a full-text evaluation, 58 articles (12%) that met the inclusion criteria were analyzed and allocated to levels of efficacy. Most eligible articles (n = 52, 90%) evaluated technical characteristics or the accuracy of CBCT imaging, which was defined in this model as low levels of efficacy. Only 6 articles (10%) proclaimed to evaluate the efficacy of CBCT imaging to support the practitioner\'s decision making; treatment planning; and, ultimately, the treatment outcome, which was defined as higher levels of efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: The expected ultimate benefit of CBCT imaging to the endodontic patient as evaluated by its level of diagnostic efficacy is unclear and is mainly limited to its technical and diagnostic accuracy efficacies. Even for these low levels of efficacy, current knowledge is limited.

We also reviewed cited sources and the gray literature including non-governmental organization reports.We included articles that described problems that arose, attempted solutions, lessons learned, and research questions posed regarding smoke-free policy implementation in LMICs. We excluded studies of high-income countries, institution-level implementation, voluntary smoke-free policies, smoke-free homes, and outdoor smoke-free policies. RESULTS: The academic literature review led to 4931 unique articles, reduced to 1541 after title screening, 331 after abstract screening, and 101 after full-text review.

A literature search was conducted between January 2000 and June 2014 in 7 databases. The initial search identified 2717 articles; 319 underwent abstract screening, 67 underwent full-text screening, and 25 final articles were included. This review looked at early stage breast cancer in women only, excluding ductal carcinoma in situ and advanced breast cancer. A conceptual framework was created to organize the central constructs underlying women\'s choices: clinicopathologic factors, physician factors, and individual factors with subgroups of sociodemographic, geographic, and personal beliefs and preferences. This framework guided our review\'s synthesis and analysis. We found that larger tumor size and increasing stage was associated with increased rates of mastectomy. The results for age varied, but suggested that old and young extremes of diagnostic age were associated with an increased likelihood of mastectomy. Higher socioeconomic status was associated with higher breast conservation therapy (BCT) rates. Resident rural location and increasing distance from radiation treatment facilities were associated with lower rates of BCT. Individual belief factors influencing women\'s choice of mastectomy (mastectomy being reassuring, avoiding radiation, an expedient treatment) differed from factors influencing choice of BCT (body image and femininity, physician recommendation, survival equivalence, less surgery). Surgeon factors, including female gender, higher case numbers, and individual surgeon practice, were associated with increased BCT rates. The decision-making process for women with early stage breast cancer is complicated and affected by multiple factors. Organizing these factors into central constructs of clinicopathologic, individual, and physician factors may aid health-care professionals to better understand this process.','Gu J and Groot G and Boden C and Busch A and Holtslander L and Lim H','Clinical breast cancer',NULL,'Age Factors,Breast Neoplasms/pathology/psychology/*surgery,Choice Behavior,*Decision Making,Female,Humans,Mastectomy/*statistics & numerical data,Mastectomy, Segmental/statistics & numerical data,Professional-Patient Relations,Socioeconomic Factors'),(117,2,'29150369','29150369','Trial registration in pediatric surgery trials.','BACKGROUND: Prospective clinical trial registration serves to increase transparency and to mitigate selective reporting bias. An assessment of adult surgical trials revealed poor trial registration practice with incomplete provision of information in registries and inconsistent information in the corresponding publication.

We aimed to determine the proportion and adequacy of clinical trial registration in pediatric surgery trials published in 2014. METHODS: Using sensitive search strategies in MEDLINE, abstracts and full-texts of prospective pediatric intervention studies published in 2014 were screened in duplicate. Pediatric surgical trials were included. Clinical trial registration numbers obtained from publications were searched in trial registries. Data were extracted based on WHO 20-item minimum data set to determine the completeness of registration data. The proportion of registered trials was recorded and registration data were compared to reported data in the corresponding publication. RESULTS: Our search and abstract screening identified 3375 articles for full text review. Following coding, a total of 54 pediatric surgical trials were included and analyzed; 28% (15/54) of which published a registration number. In trials which reported a registration number, 40% (6/15) were retrospectively registered and 40% (6/15) had made changes to their registered primary and/or secondary outcome measures. One included published trial reported an incorrect registration number.

Existing systematic reviews have generally concluded that multifocal IOLs result in better uncorrected near vision and greater spectacle independence, but more unwanted visual phenomena such as glare and halos, compared to monofocal IOLs. However, the certainty of evidence has been low for most outcomes, and pooled analyses have grouped together technologically obsolete lenses with newer lenses, potentially obscuring differences in performance across different lens types. METHODS: We performed a systematic review searching for RCTs of a multifocal IOL to a standard IOL or monovision that reported spectacle independence, visual acuity, or quality of life. Databases were searched from 1/1/2006-4/30/2017. Existing reviews were used to identify older studies. Title/abstract screening and data extraction were done in duplicate. Where possible, random effects meta-analysis was performed to synthesize results. In addition to comparing multifocal IOLs as a group to monofocal IOLs, we also compared newer diffractive lenses to obsolete or refractive lenses. RESULTS: Twenty-five eligible studies were identified. There was no difference in pooled estimates of corrected or uncorrected distance vision between multifocal and standard IOLs. Compared to monofocal IOLs, multifocal IOLs had statistically significantly better pooled results for the outcome of near vision (10 studies, 1025 patients, mean difference in logMAR of -0.26 (95% CI -0.37, -0.15)); spectacle dependence (12 studies, 1237 patients, relative risk of 0.27 (95% CI 0.20, 0.38)) and borderline significantly better quality of vision (6 studies, 596 patients, standardized mean difference of -0.54, (95% CI -1.12, 0.04)). Compared to monofocal IOLs, multifocal IOLs had statistically significantly worse pooled results for the outcomes of glare (9 studies, 847 patients, risk ratio of 1.36 (95% CI 1.15, 1.61) and halos (7 studies, 754 patients, risk ratio of 3.14 (95% CI 1.63, 6.08). Newer multifocal lenses had statistically significantly better outcomes than older diffractive lenses or refractive lenses, when compared to monofocal IOLs, in near vision, quality of vision, and risk of halos. CONCLUSIONS: Multifocal IOLs compared to standard IOLs or monovision result in better uncorrected near vision and a higher proportion of patients who achieve spectacle independence, but greater risk of unwanted visual phenomena. Newer diffractive lenses may be better than refractive lenses in near vision and quality of vision outcomes, with less risk of halos than older diffractive lenses and refractive lenses.

Eleven unique tools were identified. The most commonly used tool was the Surgeon General\'s My Family Health Portrait (n =9/27). Only six studies directly evaluated participant perceptions shown to be associated with tool uptake. Studies tended to focus on improving compatibility by customizing tools to the target population\'s needs and use of educational interventions. Results from this review suggest the need to evaluate strategies to increase the pace of uptake of community-facing FHH tools. These include pragmatic trials that compare different approaches to engage and evaluate participant perceptions of the relative advantage and complexity of tools. Ancillary support strategies may include collaborations with community networks to facilitate use and implementation study designs for rigorous evaluation.','Allen CG and Duquette D and Guan Y and McBride CM','Journal of community genetics',NULL,''),(123,2,'31935267','31935267','Error rates of human reviewers during abstract screening in systematic reviews.','BACKGROUND: Automated approaches to improve the efficiency of systematic reviews are greatly needed. When testing any of these approaches, the criterion standard of comparison (gold standard) is usually human reviewers. Yet, human reviewers make errors in inclusion and exclusion of references. OBJECTIVES: To determine citation false inclusion and false exclusion rates during abstract screening by pairs of independent reviewers. These rates can help in designing, testing and implementing automated approaches. METHODS: We identified all systematic reviews conducted between 2010 and 2017 by an evidence-based practice center in the United States. Eligible reviews had to follow standard systematic review procedures with dual independent screening of abstracts and full texts, in which citation inclusion by one reviewer prompted automatic inclusion through the next level of screening. Disagreements between reviewers during full text screening were reconciled via consensus or arbitration by a third reviewer. A false inclusion or exclusion was defined as a decision made by a single reviewer that was inconsistent with the final included list of studies. RESULTS: We analyzed a total of 139,467 citations that underwent 329,332 inclusion and exclusion decisions from 86 unique reviewers. The final systematic reviews included 5.48% of the potential references identified through bibliographic database search (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.38% to 8.58%). After abstract screening, the total error rate (false inclusion and false exclusion) was 10.76% (95% CI: 7.43% to 14.09%). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests important false inclusion and exclusion rates by human reviewers. When deciding the validity of a future automated study selection algorithm, it is important to keep in mind that the gold standard is not perfect and that achieving error rates similar to humans may be adequate and can save resources and time.','Wang Z and Nayfeh T and Tetzlaff J and O\'Blenis P and Murad MH','PloS one',NULL,'Abstracting and Indexing,Algorithms,Databases, Bibliographic,Electronic Data Processing,Humans,Research Design,*Systematic Reviews as Topic'),(124,2,'31053555','31053555','Qigong in the treatment of children with autism spectrum disorder: A systematic review.','BACKGROUND: Autism spectrum disorder is a condition that affects all races, ethnic and socioeconomic groups. With a high incidence ratio of one in every 68, it has become one of the most discussed psychiatric disorders. For this reason, the need for investigating novel treatments has been emerging. Qigong, a traditional Chinese mind-body technique, has already proven to be able to reduce symptoms of several physical and psychological illnesses. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this systematic review is to examine and categorize the current scientific evidence regarding the efficacy of Qigong on children suffering from autism spectrum disorders. SEARCH STRATEGY: A systematic literature search of the electronic scientific databases PubMed, Clinical Trials.gov, BioMed Central, PubMed Central and Google Scholar was performed to identify studies of Qigong in the treatment of children with autism spectrum disorder. INCLUSION CRITERIA: This review included randomized controlled trials, replication studies, retrospective studies and observational follow-up studies of Qigong on children with autism spectrum disorder. Case reports and case series were excluded. DATA EXTRACTION AND ANALYSIS: Two researchers independently evaluated the methodological quality of all included studies. Any discrepancies were solved by discussion until consensus was achieved. RESULTS: Our literature search identified 157 publications, and 10 additional publications from hand search of references. After duplicate removal, 103 records remained. After the title/abstract screening, 19 publications were obtained for detailed evaluation. After detailed evaluation, 10 studies were included. Seven studies were conducted with small children with 2-6years old employing Qigong massage, and three studies were conducted with older children aged 7-17years old applying both Qigong massage (one study) and Neigong (two studies). CONCLUSION: Studies demonstrated that Qigong has interesting and promising applicability and effect on children with autism spectrum disorder and should be tested further. Despite the need for more rigorous controlled studies, Qigong seems to be able to decrease severity of individual sensory, behavioural, and language components of autism, and improve self-control, sociability, sensory and cognitive awareness as well as healthy-physical behaviour. Besides positive effect on children and adolescents, benefits seem to extend to parents and caregivers as well. However, quality of methodology seems to be insufficient to state that Qigong is an alternative to common behavioural therapies. We suggest that, until more investigation is performed, Qigong may only be used as a complement, or when behavioural therapies are not accessible.','Rodrigues JM and Mestre M and Fredes LI','Journal of integrative medicine',NULL,'Adolescent,Autism Spectrum Disorder/*therapy,Child,Child, Preschool,Humans,Qigong/*methods'),(125,2,'29020814','29020814','The Effect of Socioeconomic Factors on Outcomes of Distal Radius Fractures: A Systematic Review.','BACKGROUND: Socioeconomic factors are known to affect outcomes for both medical and surgical conditions. The purpose of this systematic review was to assess the current evidence regarding the effect of socioeconomic factors such as income, geographic location, educational level, and occupation on clinical outcomes after distal radius fractures. METHODS: A systematic search strategy was performed to identify studies commenting on the effect of socioeconomic factors on clinical outcomes following open or closed distal radius fracture repair. Abstract and full-text screening was performed by 2 independent reviewers, and articles were evaluated by Structured Effectiveness Quality Evaluation Scale (SEQES). Treatment outcomes of interest included, but were not limited to, pain, function, range of motion, and grip strength. RESULTS: There were 1745 studies that met our inclusion and exclusion criteria for abstract screening. Of these, 48 studies met our inclusion criteria for full-text screening and 20 studies met our criteria for quality analysis with the SEQES score. There were 3 studies of high quality, 16 of moderate quality, and 1 of low quality. Meta-analyses were not possible due to the variability in outcomes of interest across papers.

However, there is limited knowledge and academic consensus regarding the abilities and knowledge a child or young person should possess for making sound health decisions. The research presented in this review addresses this gap by providing an overview and synthesis of current understandings of health literacy in childhood and youth. Furthermore, the authors aim to understand to what extent available models capture the unique needs and characteristics of children and young people. METHOD: Six databases were systematically searched with relevant search terms in English and German. Of the n = 1492 publications identified, N = 1021 entered the abstract screening and N = 340 full-texts were screened for eligibility. A total of 30 articles, which defined or conceptualized generic health literacy for a target population of 18 years or younger, were selected for a four-step inductive content analysis. RESULTS: The systematic review of the literature identified 12 definitions and 21 models that have been specifically developed for children and young people. In the literature, health literacy in children and young people is described as comprising variable sets of key dimensions, each appearing as a cluster of related abilities, skills, commitments, and knowledge that enable a person to approach health information competently and effectively and to derive at health-promoting decisions and actions. DISCUSSION: Identified definitions and models are very heterogeneous, depicting health literacy as multidimensional, complex construct. Moreover, health literacy is conceptualized as an action competence, with a strong focus on personal attributes, while also recognising its interrelatedness with social and contextual determinants. Life phase specificities are mainly considered from a cognitive and developmental perspective, leaving children\'s and young people\'s specific needs, vulnerabilities, and social structures poorly incorporated within most models. While a critical number of definitions and models were identified for youth or secondary school students, similar findings are lacking for children under the age of ten or within a primary school context.','Broder J and Okan O and Bauer U and Bruland D and Schlupp S and Bollweg TM and Saboga-Nunes L and Bond E and Sorensen K and Bitzer EM and Jordan S and Domanska O and Firnges C and Carvalho GS and Bittlingmayer UH and Levin-Zamir D and Pelikan J and Sahrai D and Lenz A and Wahl P and Thomas M and Kessl F and Pinheiro P','BMC public health',NULL,'Adolescent,Child,*Health Literacy,Humans,*Models, Theoretical'),(127,2,'32750011','32750011','Usability Methods and Attributes Reported in Usability Studies of Mobile Apps for Health Care Education: Protocol for a Scoping Review.','BACKGROUND: E-learning technologies, including mobile apps, are used to a large extent in health care education. Mobile apps can provide extendable learning environments and motivate students for adaptive and collaborative learning outside the classroom context. Developers should design practical, effective, and easy-to-use mobile apps. Usability testing is an important part of app development in order to understand if apps meet the needs of users. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to perform a scoping review of usability methods and attributes reported in usability studies of mobile apps for health care education. METHODS: The scoping review is guided by the methodological framework developed by Arksey & O\'Malley and further developed by Levac et al and Kahlil et al. The stages we will follow are as follows: (1) identifying the research question; (2) identifying relevant studies; (3) selecting studies; (4) charting the data; and (5) summarizing and reporting the results. We have developed two research questions to meet the aim of the study, which are as follows: (1) What usability methods are used to evaluate the usability of mobile apps for health care education? and (2) What usability attributes are reported in the usability studies of mobile apps for health care education? We will apply a comprehensive search of the literature, including 10 databases, a reference search, and a search for grey literature. Two review authors will independently screen articles for eligibility. RESULTS: The initial electronic database searches were completed in March 2019. The literature search identified 14,297 unique references. Following title and abstract screening, the full texts of 369 records were obtained. The scoping review is expected to be completed in spring 2021. CONCLUSIONS: We expect the overview of usability methods and attributes reported in usability studies of mobile apps for health care education to contribute to the knowledge base for researchers and developers. It will give an overview of the research field and provide researchers and developers with relevant and important information on the usability research area, including highlighting possible research gaps.

Previous research on ethnic health inequalities focused on established minority ethnic groups, whereas Eastern European migrants are a growing, but relatively under-researched group. We aimed to conduct a systematic scoping review of published literature on Eastern European migrants\' use and experiences of UK health services. METHODS: An initial search of nine databases produced 5997 relevant publications. Removing duplicates reduced the figure to 2198. Title and abstract screening left 73 publications. Full-text screening narrowed this down further to 10 articles, with three more from these publications to leave 13 included publications. We assessed publications for quality, extracted data and undertook a narrative synthesis. RESULTS: The included publications most commonly studied sexual health and family planning services. For Eastern European migrants in the UK, the most commonly cited barriers to accessing and using healthcare were limited understanding of how the system worked and language difficulties. It was also common for migrants to return to their home country to a healthcare system they were familiar with, free from language barriers. Familial and social networks were valuable for patients with a limited command of English in the absence of suitable and available interpreting and translating services. CONCLUSIONS: To address limited understanding of the healthcare system and the English language, the NHS could produce information in all the Eastern European languages about how it operates. Adding nationality to the Electronic Patient Report Form (EPRF) may reveal the demand for interpretation and translation services. Eastern European migrants need to be encouraged to register with GPs to reduce A&E attendance for primary care conditions. Many of the issues raised will be relevant to other European countries since the long-term outcomes from Brexit are likely to influence the level of Eastern European and non-Eastern European migration across the continent, not just the UK.','Phung VH and Asghar Z and Matiti M and Siriwardena AN','BMC health services research',NULL,''),(129,2,'30846354','30846354','Ethnic variations in compulsory detention under the Mental Health Act: a systematic review and meta-analysis of international data.','BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests that black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) groups have an increased risk of involuntary psychiatric care. However, to our knowledge, there is no published meta-analysis that brings together both international and UK literature and allows for comparison of the two. This study examined compulsory detention in BAME and migrant groups in the UK and internationally, and aimed to expand upon existing systematic reviews and meta-analyses of the rates of detention for BAME populations. METHODS: For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched five databases (PsychINFO, MEDLINE, Cochrane Controlled Register of Trials, Embase, and CINAHL) for quantitative studies comparing involuntary admission, readmission, and inpatient bed days between BAME or migrant groups and majority or native groups, published between inception and Dec 3, 2018. We extracted data on study characteristics, patient-level data on diagnosis, age, sex, ethnicity, marital status, and occupational status, and our outcomes of interest (involuntary admission to hospital, readmission to hospital, and inpatient bed days) for meta-analysis. We used a random-effects model to compare disparate outcome measures. We assessed explanations offered for the differences between minority and majority groups for the strength of the evidence supporting them. This study is prospectively registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42017078137. FINDINGS: Our search identified 9511 studies for title and abstract screening, from which we identified 296 potentially relevant full-text articles. Of these, 67 met the inclusion criteria and were reviewed in depth. We added four studies after reference and citation searches, meaning 71 studies in total were included. 1 953 135 participants were included in the studies. Black Caribbean patients were significantly more likely to be compulsorily admitted to hospital compared with those in white ethnic groups (odds ratio 2.53, 95% CI 2.03-3.16, p<0.0001). Black African patients also had significantly increased odds of being compulsorily admitted to hospital compared with white ethnic groups (2.27, 1.62-3.19, p<0.0001), as did, to a lesser extent, south Asian patients (1.33, 1.07-1.65, p=0.0091). Black Caribbean patients were also significantly more likely to be readmitted to hospital compared with white ethnic groups (2.30, 1.22-4.34, p=0.0102). Migrant groups were significantly more likely to be compulsorily admitted to hospital compared with native groups (1.50, 1.21-1.87, p=0.0003). The most common explanations for the increased risk of detainment in BAME populations included increased prevalence of psychosis, increased perceived risk of violence, increased police contact, absence of or mistrust of general practitioners, and ethnic disadvantages. INTERPRETATION: BAME and migrant groups are at a greater risk of psychiatric detention than are majority groups, although there is variation across ethnic groups. Attempts to explain increased detention in ethnic groups should avoid amalgamation and instead carry out culturally-specific, hypothesis-driven studies to examine the numerous contributors to varying rates of detention.

While many adjuncts to LA agents have been studied, it is unclear which adjuncts are most effective for co-infiltration to improve and prolong analgesia. We performed a systematic review on adjuncts (excluding epinephrine) to local infiltrative anesthesia to determine their analgesic efficacy and opioid-sparing properties. Multiple databases were searched up to December 2019 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and two reviewers independently performed title/abstract screening and full-text review. Inclusion criteria were (1) adult surgical patients and (2) adjunct and LA agents infiltration into the surgical wound or subcutaneous tissue for postoperative analgesia. To focus on wound infiltration, studies on intra-articular, peri-tonsillar, or fascial plane infiltration were excluded. The primary outcome was reduction in postoperative opioid requirement. Secondary outcomes were time-to-first analgesic use, postoperative pain score, and any reported adverse effects. We screened 6670 citations, reviewed 126 full-text articles, and included 89 RCTs. Adjuncts included opioids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, steroids, alpha-2 agonists, ketamine, magnesium, neosaxitoxin, and methylene blue. Alpha-2 agonists have the most evidence to support their use as adjuncts to LA infiltration. Fentanyl, ketorolac, dexamethasone, magnesium and several other agents show potential as adjuncts but require more evidence. Most studies support the safety of these agents. Our findings suggest benefits of several adjuncts to local infiltrative anesthesia for postoperative analgesia. Further well-powered RCTs are needed to compare various infiltration regimens and agents.

The role of lymphadenectomy in surgical management of endometrial cancer remains controversial. Lymph node metastases can be found in approximately 10% of women who before surgery are thought to have cancer confined to the womb. Removal of all pelvic and para-aortic lymph nodes (lymphadenectomy) at initial surgery has been widely advocated, and pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy remains part of the FIGO (International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics) staging system for endometrial cancer. This recommendation is based on data from studies that suggested improvement in survival following pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy. However, these studies were not randomised controlled trials (RCTs), and treatment of pelvic lymph nodes may not confer a direct therapeutic benefit, other than allocating women to poorer prognosis groups. Furthermore, the Cochrane review and meta-analysis of RCTs of routine adjuvant radiotherapy to treat possible lymph node metastases in women with early-stage endometrial cancer found no survival advantage. Surgical removal of pelvic and para-aortic lymph nodes has serious potential short-term and long-term sequelae. Therefore, it is important to investigate the clinical value of this treatment. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of lymphadenectomy for the management of endometrial cancer. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and Embase to June 2009 for the original review, updated the search to June 2015 for the last updated version and further extended the search to March 2017 for this version of the review. We also searched registers of clinical trials, abstracts of scientific meetings, and reference lists of included studies, and we contacted experts in the field. SELECTION CRITERIA: RCTs and quasi-RCTs that compared lymphadenectomy versus no lymphadenectomy in adult women diagnosed with endometrial cancer. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Hazard ratios (HRs) for overall and progression-free survival and risk ratios (RRs) comparing adverse events in women who received lymphadenectomy versus those with no lymphadenectomy were pooled in random-effects meta-analyses. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach. MAIN RESULTS: 978 unique references were identified via the search strategy. All but 50 were excluded by title and abstract screening. Three RCTs met the inclusion criteria; for one small RCT, data were insufficient for inclusion in the meta-analysis. The two RCTs included in the analysis randomly assigned 1945 women, reported HRs for survival adjusted for prognostic factors and based on 1851 women and had an overall low risk of bias, as they satisfied four of the assessment criteria. The third study had an overall unclear risk of bias, as information provided was not adequate concerning random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, or completeness of outcome reporting.Results of the meta-analysis remained unchanged from the previous versions of this review and indicated no differences in overall and recurrence-free survival between women who underwent lymphadenectomy and those who did not undergo lymphadenectomy (pooled hazard ratio (HR) 1.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81 to 1.43; HR 1.23, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.58 for overall and recurrence-free survival, respectively) (1851 participants, two studies; moderate-quality evidence).We found no difference in risk of direct surgical morbidity between women who underwent lymphadenectomy and those who did not undergo lymphadenectomy. However, women who underwent lymphadenectomy had a significantly higher risk of surgery-related systemic morbidity and lymphoedema/lymphocyst formation than those who did not undergo lymphadenectomy (RR 3.72, 95% CI 1.04 to 13.27; RR 8.39, 95% CI 4.06 to 17.33 for risk of surgery-related systemic morbidity and lymphoedema/lymphocyst formation, respectively) (1922 participants, two studies; high-quality evidence). AUTHORS\' CONCLUSIONS: This review found no evidence that lymphadenectomy decreases risk of death or disease recurrence compared with no lymphadenectomy in women with presumed stage I disease. Evidence on serious adverse events suggests that women who undergo lymphadenectomy are more likely to experience surgery-related systemic morbidity or lymphoedema/lymphocyst formation. Currently, no RCT evidence shows the impact of lymphadenectomy in women with higher-stage disease and in those at high risk of disease recurrence.','Frost JA and Webster KE and Bryant A and Morrison J','The Cochrane database of systematic reviews',NULL,'Adult,Disease-Free Survival,Endometrial Neoplasms/*surgery,Female,Humans,Lymph Node Excision/*adverse effects/mortality,Lymphatic Metastasis,Lymphedema/etiology,Lymphocele/etiology,Postoperative Complications/etiology,Quality of Life,Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic'),(132,2,'29228985','29228985','Investigating the burden of antibiotic resistance in ethnic minority groups in high-income countries: protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis.','BACKGROUND: Antibiotic resistance (ABR) is an urgent problem globally, with overuse and misuse of antibiotics being one of the main drivers of antibiotic-resistant infections. There is increasing evidence that the burden of community-acquired infections such as urinary tract infections and bloodstream infections (both susceptible and resistant) may differ by ethnicity, although the reasons behind this relationship are not well defined. It has been demonstrated that socioeconomic status and ethnicity are often highly correlated with each other; however, it is not yet known whether accounting for deprivation completely explains any discrepancy seen in infection risk. There have currently been no systematic reviews summarising the evidence for the relationship between ethnicity and antibiotic resistance or prescribing. METHODS: This protocol will outline how we will conduct this systematic literature review and meta-analysis investigating whether there is an association between patient ethnicity and (1) risk of antibiotic-resistant infections or (2) levels of antibiotic prescribing in high-income countries. We will search PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, Global Health, Scopus and CINAHL using MESH terms where applicable. Two reviewers will conduct title/abstract screening, data extraction and quality assessment independently. The Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) checklist will be used for cohort and case-control studies, and the Cochrane collaboration\'s risk of bias tool will be used for randomised control trials, if they are included. Meta-analyses will be performed by calculating the minority ethnic group to majority ethnic group odds ratios or risk ratios for each study and presenting an overall pooled odds ratio for the two outcomes. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessments, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach will be used to assess the overall quality of the body of evidence. DISCUSSION: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we will aim to collate the available evidence of whether there is a difference in rates of AMR and/or antibiotic prescribing in minority vs. majority ethnic groups in high-income countries. Additionally, this review will highlight areas where more research needs to be conducted and may provide insight into what may cause differences in this relationship, should they be seen.

This disorder leads to the systemic circulation of oxygen-poor blood (cyanosis), with associated features and consequences in the oral cavity. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Using scoping review methodology for screening and article selection, the primary objectives of this paper were as follows: first, to pose a research question; second, to identify relevant studies in order to answer the research question; third, to select and retrieve the studies; fourth, to chart the critical data, and finally, to collate, summarize, and report the results from the most important articles on the dental management of children affected with PA/VSD.

This formalised training has been successfully adapted and used to in the field of surgery to improve post-operative patient outcomes. The need to implement teamwork training as an integral part of a surgical programme is increasingly being recognised. We aim to systematically review the impact of surgical teamwork training on post-operative outcomes. METHODS: Two independent researchers systematically searched MEDLINE and Embase in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Studies were screened and subjected to inclusion/exclusion criteria. Study characteristics and outcomes were reported and analysed. RESULTS: Our initial search identified 2720 articles. Following duplicate removal, title and abstract screening, 107 full text articles were analysed. Eight articles met our inclusion criteria. Overall, three articles supported a positive effect of good teamwork on post-operative patient outcomes. We identified key areas in study methodology that can be improved upon, including small cohort size, lack of unified training programme, and short training duration, should future studies be designed and implemented in this field. CONCLUSION: At present, there is insufficient evidence to support the hypothesis that teamwork training interventions improve patient outcomes. We believe that non-significant and conflicting results can be attributed to flaws in methodology and non-uniform training methods.

Abstract screening produced 112 articles to be read in their entirety, of which 17 articles studying 515 procedures with a mean +/- SD follow-up of 54.21 +/- 20.64 months met all of the inclusion criteria necessary for analysis. RESULTS: Overall crude patient satisfaction after flexor digitorum longus tendon transfer was 86.7% (95% confidence interval, 81.7%-90.5%). A low grade of heterogeneity across studies (Q = 24.458, I(2) =34.583, P = .080) and no influence of the individual studies on overall estimation were found. When adjusting for higher-quality prospective studies, overall patient satisfaction increased to 91.8%, although it did not reach statistical significance. Additional a priori sources of heterogeneity (age, sex, studies with <3 years of follow-up, percentage of patients lost to follow-up, and year of publication) were evaluated by subgroup analysis and meta-regression, but no statistical significance was found. This adjustment also significantly decreased heterogeneity across studies (crude Q = 24.458, high-quality studies Q = 1.504). CONCLUSIONS: Regarding patient satisfaction, this comprehensive analysis provides supportive evidence of the clinical benefit of flexor digitorum longus tendon transfer.','Losa Iglesias ME and Becerro de Bengoa Vallejo R and Jules KT and Trepal MJ','Journal of the American Podiatric Medical Association',NULL,'Humans,Patient Satisfaction,Tendon Transfer/*methods,Toes/*abnormalities/*surgery'),(137,2,'32720345','32720345','Systematic review and meta-analysis of patient race/ethnicity, socioeconomics, and quality for adult type 2 diabetes.','OBJECTIVE: To review the evidence of the association between performance in eight indicators of diabetes care and a patient\'s race/ethnicity and socioeconomic characteristics. DATA SOURCE: Studies of adult patients with type 2 diabetes in MEDLINE published between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2018. STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis of regression-based studies including race/ethnicity and income or education as explanatory variables. Meta-analysis was used to quantify differences in performance associated with patient race/ethnicity or socioeconomic characteristics. The systematic review was used to identify potential mechanisms of disparities. DATA COLLECTION: Two coauthors separately conducted abstract screening, study exclusions, data extraction, and scoring of retained studies. Estimates in retained studies were extracted and, where applicable, were standardized and converted to odds ratios and standard errors. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Performance in intermediate outcomes and process measures frequently exhibited differences by race/ethnicity even after adjustment for socioeconomic, lifestyle, and health factors. Meta-analyses showed black patients had lower odds of HbA1c and blood pressure (BP) control (OR range: 0.67-0.68, P < .05) but higher odds of receiving eye or foot examination (OR range: 1.22-1.47, P < .05) relative to white patients. A high school degree or more was associated with higher odds of HbA1c control and receipt of eye examinations compared to patients without a degree. Meta-analyses of income included a handful of studies and were inconsistently associated with diabetes care performance. Differences in diabetes performance appear to be related to access-related factors such as uninsurance or lacking a usual source of care; food insecurity and trade-offs at very low incomes; and lower adherence among younger and healthier diabetes patients. CONCLUSIONS: Patient race/ethnicity and education were associated with differences in diabetes quality measures. Depending on the approach used to rate providers, not adjusting for these patient characteristics may penalize or reward providers based on the populations they serve.','Lee W and Lloyd JT and Giuriceo K and Day T and Shrank W and Rajkumar R','Health services research',NULL,''),(138,2,'31712000','31712000','Dry eye after refractive surgery: a meta-analysis.','OBJECTIVE: To examine and compare the rates of dry eye after various refractive surgeries, including laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK), photorefractive keratectomy (PRK), femtosecond lamellar extraction (FLEx), and small incision lenticule extraction (SMILE). DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement guidelines. Databases searched included MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase, Cochrane Library, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Web of Science, ProQuest Dissertations and Theses, and ClinicalTrials.gov.

Articles underwent 3 stages of screening before data extraction and meta-analysis. RESULTS: In total, 3232 studies were found; 261 remained after title screening, 92 remained after abstract screening, and 14 studies progressed to data extraction. Meta-analysis indicated a significant reduction in tear break-up time (TBUT) with LASIK (standardized mean difference [SMD]=-0.3; confidence interval [CI]: -0.53 to -0.08) and FLEx (SMD=-1.09; CI: -1.44 to -0.74), and a nonsignificant reduction in TBUT with SMILE (SMD=-0.34; CI: -0.95 to 0.27) and PRK (SMD=-0.11; CI: -0.29 to 0.08).

Color change and risk of gingival sensitivity was also evaluated. METHODS:: A comprehensive search was performed MEDLINE via PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature database (LILACS), Brazilian Library in Dentistry (BBO), EMBASE and Cochrane Library, and System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe (SIGLE) without restrictions to identify randomized clinical trials. Abstracts from the annual conference of the International Association for Dental Research (1990-2016), unpublished and ongoing trials registries, dissertations, and theses were also searched. The quality of the evidence was rated using the Grading of Recommendations: Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. DATA:: After duplicates were removed, 1352 articles were identified. After title and abstract screening, only 47 studies remained for qualitative evaluation. Most of the studies had unclear risk of bias. No difference between groups were observed for the risk ratio of TS (risk ratio = 0.99; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.74-1.33); intensity of TS (standardized difference in means [SMD] = 0.04; 95% CI = 0.79-0.70); color change in shade guide units (SMD - 0.04; 95% CI = 0.50-0.42); color change in DeltaE* (SMD = 0.41 (95% CI = 0.07-0.89); and risk ratio of gingival irritation (SMD = 1.05; 95% CI = 0.81-1.36). Except for the risk of TS, graded as moderate quality of evidence, all other outcomes were rated as low and very low quality. CONCLUSIONS:: Incorporating desensitizers in the bleaching gel did not reduce the risk of TS, and the quality of this evidence was considered moderate. On the other hand, the intensity of TS, color change, and risk of gingival irritation was similar between groups, but the quality of the evidence for these outcomes was graded as low or very low, thus reducing the level of confidence in these outcomes.','Rezende M and Coppla FM and Chemin K and Chibinski AC and Loguercio AD and Reis A','Operative dentistry',NULL,'Adult,Brazil,*Dentin Sensitivity,Gingiva,Humans,*Tooth Bleaching,*Tooth Bleaching Agents'),(140,2,'32089596','32089596','Accuracy of an intraoral digital impression: A review.','Intraoral scanners (IOSs) are used for capturing the direct optical impressions in dentistry.

Multiple interventions have been designed to improve micronutrient deficiency, and food fortification is one of them. OBJECTIVES: To assess the impact of food fortification with multiple micronutrients on health outcomes in the general population, including men, women and children. SEARCH METHODS: We searched electronic databases up to 29 August 2018, including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trial (CENTRAL), the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) Group Specialised Register and Cochrane Public Health Specialised Register; MEDLINE; Embase, and 20 other databases, including clinical trial registries. There were no date or language restrictions. We checked reference lists of included studies and relevant systematic reviews for additional papers to be considered for inclusion. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster-RCTs, quasi-randomised trials, controlled before-after (CBA) studies and interrupted time series (ITS) studies that assessed the impact of food fortification with multiple micronutrients (MMNs). Primary outcomes included anaemia, micronutrient deficiencies, anthropometric measures, morbidity, all-cause mortality and cause-specific mortality. Secondary outcomes included potential adverse outcomes, serum concentration of specific micronutrients, serum haemoglobin levels and neurodevelopmental and cognitive outcomes. We included food fortification studies from both high-income and low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently screened, extracted and quality-appraised the data from eligible studies. We carried out statistical analysis using Review Manager 5 software. We used random-effects meta-analysis for combining data, as the characteristics of study participants and interventions differed significantly. We set out the main findings of the review in \'Summary of findings\' tables, using the GRADE approach. MAIN RESULTS: We identified 127 studies as relevant through title/abstract screening, and included 43 studies (48 papers) with 19,585 participants (17,878 children) in the review. All the included studies except three compared MMN fortification with placebo/no intervention. Two studies compared MMN fortification versus iodised salt and one study compared MMN fortification versus calcium fortification alone. Thirty-six studies targeted children; 20 studies were conducted in LMICs. Food vehicles used included staple foods, such as rice and flour; dairy products, including milk and yogurt; non-dairy beverages; biscuits; spreads; and salt. Fourteen of the studies were fully commercially funded, 13 had partial-commercial funding, 14 had non-commercial funding and two studies did not specify the source of funding. We rated all the evidence as of low to very low quality due to study limitations, imprecision, high heterogeneity and small sample size. When compared with placebo/no intervention, MMN fortification may reduce anaemia by 32% (risk ratio (RR) 0.68, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.56 to 0.84; 11 studies, 3746 participants; low-quality evidence), iron deficiency anaemia by 72% (RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.39; 6 studies, 2189 participants; low-quality evidence), iron deficiency by 56% (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.60; 11 studies, 3289 participants; low-quality evidence); vitamin A deficiency by 58% (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.62; 6 studies, 1482 participants; low-quality evidence), vitamin B2 deficiency by 64% (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.68; 1 study, 296 participants; low-quality evidence), vitamin B6 deficiency by 91% (RR 0.09, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.38; 2 studies, 301 participants; low-quality evidence), vitamin B12 deficiency by 58% (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.71; 3 studies, 728 participants; low-quality evidence), weight-for-age z-scores (WAZ) (mean difference (MD) 0.1, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.17; 8 studies, 2889 participants; low-quality evidence) and weight-for-height/length z-score (WHZ/WLZ) (MD 0.1, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.18; 6 studies, 1758 participants; low-quality evidence). We are uncertain about the effect of MMN fortification on zinc deficiency (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.08; 5 studies, 1490 participants; low-quality evidence) and height/length-for-age z-score (HAZ/LAZ) (MD 0.09, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.18; 8 studies, 2889 participants; low-quality evidence). Most of the studies in this comparison were conducted in children. Subgroup analyses of funding sources (commercial versus non-commercial) and duration of intervention did not demonstrate any difference in effects, although this was a relatively small number of studies and the possible association between commercial funding and increased effect estimates has been demonstrated in the wider health literature. We could not conduct subgroup analysis by food vehicle and funding; since there were too few studies in each subgroup to draw any meaningful conclusions. When we compared MMNs versus iodised salt, we are uncertain about the effect of MMN fortification on anaemia (R 0.86, 95% CI 0.37 to 2.01; 1 study, 88 participants; very low-quality evidence), iron deficiency anaemia (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.09 to 1.83; 2 studies, 245 participants; very low-quality evidence), iron deficiency (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.17; 1 study, 88 participants; very low-quality evidence) and vitamin A deficiency (RR 0.19, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.55; 2 studies, 363 participants; very low-quality evidence). Both of the studies were conducted in children. Only one study conducted in children compared MMN fortification versus calcium fortification. None of the primary outcomes were reported in the study. None of the included studies reported on morbidity, adverse events, all-cause or cause-specific mortality. AUTHORS\' CONCLUSIONS: The evidence from this review suggests that MMN fortification when compared to placebo/no intervention may reduce anaemia, iron deficiency anaemia and micronutrient deficiencies (iron, vitamin A, vitamin B2 and vitamin B6). We are uncertain of the effect of MMN fortification on anthropometric measures (HAZ/LAZ, WAZ and WHZ/WLZ). There are no data to suggest possible adverse effects of MMN fortification, and we could not draw reliable conclusions from various subgroup analyses due to a limited number of studies in each subgroup. We remain cautious about the level of commercial funding in this field, and the possibility that this may be associated with higher effect estimates, although subgroup analysis in this review did not demonstrate any impact of commercial funding. These findings are subject to study limitations, imprecision, high heterogeneity and small sample sizes, and we rated most of the evidence low to very low quality. and hence no concrete conclusions could be drawn from the findings of this review.','Das JK and Salam RA and Mahmood SB and Moin A and Kumar R and Mukhtar K and Lassi ZS and Bhutta ZA','The Cochrane database of systematic reviews',NULL,'Anemia, Iron-Deficiency/prevention & control,*Food, Fortified,Health Status,Humans,Iodine,Micronutrients/*administration & dosage,Minerals,Nutrition Disorders/*prevention & control,Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic,Sodium Chloride, Dietary,Vitamin A Deficiency/prevention & control,Vitamins'),(143,2,'32325163','32325163','Scoping Review on Rehabilitation Scoping Reviews.','OBJECTIVE: To examine the extent, scope, and methodological quality of rehabilitation scoping reviews. DATA SOURCES: A comprehensive list of scoping reviews conducted in the broader health field (inception to July 2014), with a further update of that list (up to February 2017) using similar methods, including searching 9 electronic databases. STUDY SELECTION: Articles were included if they were scoping reviews within rehabilitation. Established review methods were used including (1) a PubMed filter detecting rehabilitation content and (2) title-and-abstract screening by 2 independent reviewers applied sequentially to articles from the existing list of scoping reviews and to the updated search results. Full-text articles were reviewed by 1 reviewer, with discrepancies resolved by another after pilot screening with > 80% agreement. Remaining discrepancies were resolved by external experts. DATA EXTRACTION: Two independent reviewers used piloted and standardized data extraction forms. DATA SYNTHESIS: We screened 1823 records, including 992 full texts, to identify 251 rehabilitation-related scoping reviews. Rehabilitation scoping reviews had an exponential yearly increase since 2008 (r(2)=0.89; P<.01). The literature addressed diverse topics (eg, spread over 43 condition groupings); 43% were published in Canada. Examples of methodological limitations included: 39% of reviews did not cite the use of a methodological framework, 96% did not include the appropriate flow diagram, 8% did not report eligibility criteria, and 57% did not report data extraction details.

A mixed method systematic review.','Purpose: To review available evidence on older people\'s ability to get up off the floor independently and determine the effectiveness of interventions to improve older adults\' ability to rise from the floor.Materials and methods: Seven databases were searched between January 1975 and June 2018. Eligibility criteria included: people aged >/=60; interventions to improve strength/function including ability to get up off the floor (for intervention studies); comparison groups (for randomized and nonrandomized controlled trials); outcome: quantitative or qualitative evaluation of ability to get up off the floor. Selection of the studies was undertaken in three stages: (1) titles and abstracts were scanned by one reviewer, (2) full abstract screening by one reviewer, and (3) articles read in full by two reviewers. Results of all articles are summarized and randomized controlled trials (RCT) (where possible) were analyzed by meta-analysis to determine intervention effectiveness.Results: Forty-one studies met inclusion criteria. For each of the RCTs that utilized resistance training and/or teaching the skill, a reduction in time to get up off the floor were reported. However, meta-analyses of all RCT interventions indicated no significant change in time for older people to get up off the floor independently with intervention (MD: -0.43[-1.38, 0.51]). Sub-analyses of interventions utilizing resistance training showed an improvement trending towards significance (MD: -0.81[-1.72, 0.09]). Heterogeneity between studies was high, therefore results should be viewed with some caution.Conclusions: Resistance training interventions may improve older people\'s ability to rise from the floor unassisted.

The present systematic review aimed to assess the effectiveness of PSI for encouraging dietary behaviour change in adults and to consider intervention characteristics linked with effectiveness. DESIGN: Electronic databases were searched until June 2018 for randomised controlled trials assessing the effectiveness of PSI compared with an alternative intervention and/or control on a dietary related outcome in adults.

Most interventions used a group model and were lay-led by peer supporters. Several studies did not report intervention intensity, fidelity and peer training and support in detail. Studies reporting positive effects employed more behaviour change techniques (BCT) than studies reporting no effect; however, heterogeneity between studies was considerable.

While one systematic review focused on suicide in farming populations in the United States, there have been no scoping studies examining mental health in farming communities worldwide. The objectives of this scoping review were to: provide a descriptive analysis of the literature pertaining to mental health outcomes in farming populations; describe the international scope of the research; and highlight published mental health services and interventions that have been evaluated. METHODS: Following Arksey and O\'Malley\'s scoping review framework, five major health and science platforms were used to identify studies examining mental health outcomes in farming populations, worldwide. Studies that met a priori inclusion criteria that were published prior to December 31, 2017 were included in this review. Data synthesis and descriptive statistics were conducted using STATA 15(R) software; proportions were calculated by country. RESULTS: The initial literature search yielded 9,906 records. After title and abstract screening, 676 articles were reviewed in-full. Of these, 341 met a priori inclusion criteria. Studies included were conducted between 1979 and 2017; the majority (265; 77.7%) were published between 2002-2017. The most frequently measured outcomes were stress (41.9%), suicide (33.1%), and depression (32.6%). Over 70% of studies that examined stress described using quantitative research methods, most predominantly, cross-sectional designs (42.7%). Approximately 64% of studies that measured suicide reported using a quantitative approach; the largest proportion of included suicide studies (33.6%) described using cohort designs. Approximately 84% of studies that measured depression described using quantitative approaches; sixty percent of these studies reported using a cross-sectional study design. Twenty included studies described a mental health service or intervention (5.9%). CONCLUSIONS: This scoping review provides a critical overview of the literature examining mental health outcomes in farming populations worldwide. Given the importance of farming and agriculture, this review can be used to ensure future research complements existing work, avoids unnecessary overlap, and begins to tackle the less-studied mental health outcomes amongst farmers. These results can guide researchers to identified gaps in research and services, leading to a more informed approach to future work, and ultimately, a more comprehensive understanding of mental health among farmers worldwide.','Hagen BNM and Albright A and Sargeant J and Winder CB and Harper SL and O\'Sullivan TL and Jones-Bitton A','PloS one',NULL,'Anxiety/epidemiology,Cohort Studies,Cross-Sectional Studies,Databases, Factual,Depression/epidemiology,Farmers/*psychology,Global Health,Humans,*Mental Health,Population Groups,Suicide'),(148,2,'32468973','32468973','Hearing loss and employment: a systematic review of the association between hearing loss and employment among adults.','BACKGROUND: Hearing loss affects over 1.3 billion individuals worldwide, with the greatest burden among adults.

A previous systematic review concluded that there was not enough information in the studies in humans to derive an exposure-response relationship. Thus, the aim of this systematic review was to derive exposure limits for microbial bioaerosols based on health effects in experimental animal studies. A systematic search was done in MEDLINE (PubMed) for long-term in vivo exposure of the respiratory system via inhalation of a quantified microbial bioaerosol. A total of n=301 studies were retrieved. Abstract screening using predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria was followed by full-text screening and standardized data extraction of study characteristics and measured outcomes. As a result, four suitable studies were identified where mice or guinea pigs were exposed for 4-12 weeks to a previously described mixture of fungal spores or conidia via inhalation. The number of macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils and lymphocytes following subchronic exposure has been reported by all included papers and suggested a dose- and time-dependent relationship. Significant inflammation was observed following subacute exposure to Aspergillus fumigatus. However, the outcomes of the studies could not be directly compared due to the large degree of variation and poor description of the exposure conditions. It is our conclusion that more experimental research needs to be done with the specific aim of establishing a No-Observed-Adverse-Effect Level (NOAEL) and a Lowest-Observed-Adverse-Effect Level (LOAEL) for exposure to microbial bioaerosols in ambient air. Expertise of both exposure and outcome assessment should be brought together to enable standardization of experimental animal studies with properly generated aerosols aiming to derive health-based exposure limits.','Zamfir M and Gerstner DG and Walser SM and Bunger J and Eikmann T and Heinze S and Kolk A and Nowak D and Raulf M and Sagunski H and Sedlmaier N and Suchenwirth R and Wiesmuller GA and Wollin KM and Tesseraux I and Herr CEW','International journal of hygiene and environmental health',NULL,'Aerosols/*standards/*toxicity,Air Microbiology,Animals,Bacteria,Environmental Exposure/*standards,Fungi'),(151,2,'32881216','32881216','Feeding Modifications and Additional Primary Caregiver Support for Infants Exposed to Zika Virus or diagnosed with Congenital Zika Syndrome: A Rapid Review of the Evidence.','OBJECTIVE: Infants exposed to Zika virus (ZIKV) or diagnosed with Congenital Zika Syndrome (CZVS) may present dysphagia, regurgitation, and other feeding difficulties. They may require special feeding practices to minimize the risk of mortality, morbidity, and developmental problems. Improving knowledge, skills and behaviors of caregivers may preserve health, maximize development, and promote quality of life among affected infants. We reviewed intervention studies of modified feeding practices and additional primary caregiver support to improve outcomes among infants 0 to 12 months of age exposed to ZIKV or diagnosed with CZVS. METHODS: Rapid review and meta-analysis. We searched Pubmed/MEDLINE and contacted experts. The search is current to 18 July 2020. We planned a meta-analysis using fixed-effect models; if unfeasible, we intended to summarize studies narratively. We planned to assess risk of bias of included studies and quality of evidence using Cochrane guidance. RESULTS: We identified 42 records for title and abstract screening; 14 were eligible for full-text assessment. Among these, no intervention studies were found. Eight observational studies reported on the nutritional status, feeding practices, and outcomes among infants affected by ZIKV or diagnosed with CZVS. They are presented and discussed to provide a basis for future research. CONCLUSIONS: While no intervention studies were found, evidence from eight observational studies highlights the need for early nutrition interventions and caregiver support among infants affected by ZIKV or diagnosed with CZSV. More research is needed to assess whether modifications of feeding practices and provision of additional primary caregiver support will impact outcomes of interest.','Sales Martinez S and Pardo-Hernandez H and Palacios C','Tropical medicine & international health : TM & IH',NULL,''),(152,2,'29017574','29017574','Recommendations for reporting of systematic reviews and meta-analyses of diagnostic test accuracy: a systematic review.','BACKGROUND: This study is to perform a systematic review of existing guidance on quality of reporting and methodology for systematic reviews of diagnostic test accuracy (DTA) in order to compile a list of potential items that might be included in a reporting guideline for such reviews: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses of Diagnostic Test Accuracy (PRISMA-DTA).

To optimize epilepsy control in patients with kidney disease, clinicians need to be aware of how antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are affected by impaired renal function and how the kidneys are affected by epilepsy management strategies. Herein we present a narrative review with systematic literature search to discuss the use of AEDs in patients with renal impairment, including those undergoing dialysis, as well as the nephrotoxic effects of some AEDs. We finally conclude the article by providing practical tips about our approach to using AEDs in the setting of renal disease. METHODS: A literature search targeting epilepsy management in patients with kidney disease was performed in MEDLINE database (1946 to 7(th) Jan 2019). RESULTS: A total of 1193 articles were found. After duplicate removal, title and abstract screening followed by full text screening, a total of 110 references were included in this review. Additional information was included from drug product monographs. CONCLUSION: The disposition of AEDs can be altered in patients with impaired renal function, leading to a higher risk of AED toxicity or therapy failure. Renal dosage adjustment and close monitoring is recommended. Although AED-induced nephrotoxicity is rare, it is unpredictable and clinicians need to vigilant about this possibility. In addition, AEDs renal adverse reactions and renal drug interactions should be considered when selecting an AED.','Mahmoud SH and Zhou XY and Ahmed SN','Seizure',NULL,''),(154,2,'26519130','26519130','Tackling malnutrition: a systematic review of 15-year research evidence from INDEPTH health and demographic surveillance systems.','BACKGROUND: Nutrition is the intake of food in relation to the body\'s dietary needs. Malnutrition results from the intake of inadequate or excess food. This can lead to reduced immunity, increased susceptibility to disease, impaired physical and mental development, and reduced productivity. OBJECTIVE: To perform a systematic review to assess research conducted by the International Network for the Demographic Evaluation of Populations and their Health (INDEPTH) of health and demographic surveillance systems (HDSSs) over a 15-year period on malnutrition, its determinants, the effects of under and over nutrition, and intervention research on malnutrition in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). METHODS: Relevant publication titles were uploaded onto the Zotero research tool from different databases (60% from PubMed). Using the keywords \'nutrition\', \'malnutrition\', \'over and under nutrition\', we selected publications that were based only on data generated through the longitudinal HDSS platform. All titles and abstracts were screened to determine inclusion eligibility and full articles were independently assessed according to inclusion/exclusion criteria. For inclusion in this study, papers had to cover research on at least one of the following topics: the problem of malnutrition, its determinants, its effects, and intervention research on malnutrition. One hundred and forty eight papers were identified and reviewed, and 67 were selected for this study. RESULTS: The INDEPTH research identified rising levels of overweight and obesity, sometimes in the same settings as under-nutrition. Urbanisation appears to be protective against under-nutrition, but it heightens the risk of obesity. Appropriately timed breastfeeding interventions were protective against malnutrition. CONCLUSIONS: Although INDEPTH has expanded the global knowledge base on nutrition, many questions remain unresolved. There is a need for more investment in nutrition research in LMICs in order to generate evidence to inform policies in these settings.','Arthur SS and Nyide B and Soura AB and Kahn K and Weston M and Sankoh O','Global health action',NULL,'*Biomedical Research,Demography,Developing Countries,Global Health,Health Status,Humans,*Malnutrition,Nutritional Requirements,Obesity,Population Surveillance/*methods'),(155,2,'27699993','27699993','Transient elastography for the diagnosis of liver fibrosis: a systematic review of economic evaluations.','BACKGROUND: Liver biopsy remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of liver fibrosis, but its use as a diagnostic tool is limited by its invasive nature and high cost. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to systematically review the cost-effectiveness of transient elastography (TE) with and without controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) for the diagnosis of liver fibrosis or steatosis in patients with hepatitis B, hepatitis C, alcoholic liver disease and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. METHODS: An economic literature search was performed. Eligibility criteria included systematic reviews, health technology assessments or economic evaluations of TE compared to liver biopsy and other non-invasive tests. After abstract screening, full-text reports of potentially relevant articles were assessed in duplicate. The methodological quality of the included studies was also appraised. RESULTS: The database search yielded 253 records; four cost-effectiveness and four cost-utility studies were included. The methodological quality of the included studies varies. High-quality cost-effectiveness studies not only suggested that TE is less costly but also less accurate than liver biopsy. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of TE improves with a greater level of diagnostic accuracy and a higher degree of liver fibrosis. High-quality cost-utility studies indicated that TE is a cost-effective alternative to biopsy with ICER between $9000 and $14 000 per QALY for patients with hepatitis C. We did not find studies that assessed the cost-effectiveness of TE with CAP for the diagnosis of liver steatosis. CONCLUSIONS: Transient elastography is an economically attractive alternative to liver biopsy and other non-invasive diagnostic tests especially for patients with a higher degree of liver fibrosis.','van Katwyk S and Coyle D and Cooper C and Pussegoda K and Cameron C and Skidmore B and Brener S and Moher D and Thavorn K','Liver international : official journal of the International Association for the Study of the Liver',NULL,'Biopsy/economics,*Cost-Benefit Analysis,Elasticity Imaging Techniques/*economics,Hepatitis B/complications,Hepatitis C/complications,Humans,Liver Cirrhosis/*diagnostic imaging/pathology,Liver Diseases, Alcoholic/complications,Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease/complications'),(156,2,'27924350','27924350','[Use of intracutaneous or subcutaneous botulinum toxin for postherpetic neuralgia].','BACKGROUND: Botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT), a toxin of the anaerobic spore-forming bacterium Clostridium botulinum is used as a drug for alleviating muscle spasticity. Other indications include the cosmetic application in facial muscles, hyperhidrosis and neurogenic bladder disorders. It has been approved since 2010 as the first prophylactic treatment for chronic migraine. The analgesic effect of BoNT was observed early on and is currently the subject of intensive research. Painful postherpetic neuralgia is a common complication of an infection with herpes zoster virus. Despite modern treatment algorithms and medication, satisfactory pain treatment is not achieved in all patients. The use of BoNT could represent a new treatment option. AIM: The aim of this article is to provide an overview of the current evidence for the use of BoNT for postherpetic neuralgia. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature search with the keywords \"botulinum\" and \"neuropathic\" and included original articles in which BoNT was used subcutaneously or intradermally for the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia. RESULTS: The initial search yielded 212 results. After a title and abstract screening, the number was reduced to 11 relevant publications (5 case reports or series and 6 prospective studies). DISCUSSION: The results in the currently available literature show that BoNT is an effective therapeutic option for postherpetic neuralgia. In all studies, a significant effect on the pain and also on relevant patient-oriented secondary variables, such as the quality of life and especially the quality of sleep was shown.

OBJECTIVES: This overview aimed to report the evidence provided by systematic reviews (SRs) on the effect of ME on the upper airways and to assess the methodological quality of the included SRs. METHODS: Six electronic databases have been explored up to November 2017. After title and abstract screening, SRs addressing the effects of fixed palatal expanders on the dimension and function of the nasal airways were included. The methodological quality of the included SRs was assessed using the updated version of A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Review (AMSTAR-2). RESULTS: Eight SRs were included. The methodological quality of most of the included SRs ranged between low and critically low. One SR was rated of high quality. A significant increase in nasal linear dimensions was reported both in the short and long term, but supported by low-/critically low-quality SRs. The significant increase in nasal cavity volume was the only outcome supported by a high-quality SR Controversial results were found with regards to nasal function. CONCLUSION: Whenever a constricted maxilla is present general dentists, paediatricians and ENTs should be familiar with the potential improvement provided by ME. However, due to the low/critically low quality of SRs supporting these results, ME cannot be indicated only for upper airways enhancement, but should be supported by an orthodontic indication.','Bucci R and Montanaro D and Rongo R and Valletta R and Michelotti A and D\'Anto V','Journal of oral rehabilitation',NULL,'Dental Occlusion,Evidence-Based Dentistry,Humans,Mandible/anatomy & histology/pathology,Maxilla/anatomy & histology/*pathology,Maxillary Diseases/pathology/*therapy,Meta-Analysis as Topic,Nasal Cavity/anatomy & histology/*pathology,Palatal Expansion Technique/*instrumentation,Respiration,Systematic Reviews as Topic,Treatment Outcome'),(158,2,'25591409','25591409','Use of autologous fat grafting for breast reconstruction: a systematic review with meta-analysis of oncological outcomes.','BACKGROUND: There is growing interest in the use of autologous fat grafting (AFG) for breast reconstruction.

METHODS: A protocol was published on PROSPERO (CRD42013005254). Types of studies: All original studies. TYPES OF PARTICIPANTS: Women undergoing reconstruction after surgery for breast cancer. Types of Interventions: AFG techniques for reconstruction. Types of outcome measures: Oncological, clinical, aesthetic and functional, patient reported, process and radiological. Search terms and keywords: The search strategy was devised to find papers regarding AFG for breast reconstruction. DATA SOURCES: Electronic databases were searched from 1st January 1986 to 31st March 2014 including: PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, SCOPUS, The Cochrane Library, and clinical trial registries. Identification and selection of studies: Title and abstract screening and full text assessment undertaken separately by independent researchers.

RESULTS: 35 studies were included (3624 patients) with a high degree of patient and surgeon satisfaction over a mean of 1.9 sessions at 18 month follow-up. Fat necrosis was the commonest reported complication (4.4%), biopsy of a subsequent breast lump was required in 2.7% and an interval mammogram in 11.5%. The weighted mean recurrence rate was 4.4% at 24.6 months. Meta-analysis of comparative studies showed no significant difference in oncological event rates between AFG and non-AFG groups (p=0.10).

Instant gratification has been used to modify human behavior in industries such as gaming, lottery, and social media. We hypothesize that, if properly and purposefully utilized, IG can become a successful tool for encouraging best practice guideline adherence among critical care providers. Four major databases were searched with a medial librarian. Covidence application was used to identify studies pertaining to the instant gratification being used to improve provider adherence with best practice guidelines. A total of 712 studies were identified, and, through duplicates removal, title and abstract screening, and full-text screening, a total of 13 studies were included in the final review. The exclusion criteria used included the following: no provider gratification, wrong focus/intervention, wrong study design, patient-focused intervention, not generalizable, and no conclusion. There is a knowledge gap regarding instant gratification utilization to influence practice guideline adherence among providers. The intervention functions of the Behavior Change Wheel (BCW) were evident, especially \'persuasion\' and \'incentivization\', which are most pertinent to our field. The restorative process that promotes positive reinforcement can be a potential solution for alleviating inadequacies in guideline adherence. Examining interventions based on functions of the BCW has shown that an instant gratification process may have the potential in altering critical care providers\' behavior and improving guideline adherence. This review is the first step towards creating smart algorithms to instantly alert providers for their actions compliant with best practices.

We evaluated user experiences for each tool. METHODS: We subjected three SRs to two retrospective screening simulations. In each tool (Abstrackr, DistillerSR, RobotAnalyst), we screened a 200-record training set and downloaded the predicted relevance of the remaining records. We calculated the proportion missed and workload and time savings compared to dual independent screening. To test user experiences, eight research staff tried each tool and completed a survey. RESULTS: Using Abstrackr, DistillerSR, and RobotAnalyst, respectively, the median (range) proportion missed was 5 (0 to 28) percent, 97 (96 to 100) percent, and 70 (23 to 100) percent for the automated simulation and 1 (0 to 2) percent, 2 (0 to 7) percent, and 2 (0 to 4) percent for the semi-automated simulation. The median (range) workload savings was 90 (82 to 93) percent, 99 (98 to 99) percent, and 85 (85 to 88) percent for the automated simulation and 40 (32 to 43) percent, 49 (48 to 49) percent, and 35 (34 to 38) percent for the semi-automated simulation. The median (range) time savings was 154 (91 to 183), 185 (95 to 201), and 157 (86 to 172) hours for the automated simulation and 61 (42 to 82), 92 (46 to 100), and 64 (37 to 71) hours for the semi-automated simulation. Abstrackr identified 33-90% of records missed by a single reviewer. RobotAnalyst performed less well and DistillerSR provided no relative advantage. User experiences depended on user friendliness, qualities of the user interface, features and functions, trustworthiness, ease and speed of obtaining predictions, and practicality of the export file(s). CONCLUSIONS: The workload savings afforded in the automated simulation came with increased risk of missing relevant records. Supplementing a single reviewer\'s decisions with relevance predictions (semi-automated simulation) sometimes reduced the proportion missed, but performance varied by tool and SR. Designing tools based on reviewers\' self-identified preferences may improve their compatibility with present workflows.

As the prognosis of organ failure improves with early treatment, it is important to identify these patients as early as possible. Most studies on organ failure have been performed in intensive care settings, or on selected groups of patients, where a high prevalence and mortality have been reported. Before patients arrive to the intensive care unit, or the general ward, most of them have passed through the emergency department (ED), where diagnosis and treatment has been initiated. The prevalence and prognosis of acutely ill patients, with organ failure, at arrival have been studied in some selected groups, but methods and results differ. This systematic review aims to identify, summarize, and analyze studies of prevalence and prognosis of new onset organ failure in acutely ill undifferentiated patients, at arrival to hospital. The result of the review will assist physicians working in an ED, when assessing patients\' risk of organ failure and their associated prognosis. METHODS: The information sources used are electronic databases, PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and CINAHL; references in included studies and review articles; and authors\' personal files. One author will perform the title and abstract screening and exclude obviously ineligible studies. By an independent full-text screening, two authors will decide on the eligibility for the remaining studies. Eligible studies will include an unselected group of acutely ill adult patients at arrival to hospital, with one or more organ failures (respiratory, renal, cerebral, circulatory, hepatic, or coagulation failure). Included studies will have assessed the prevalence or prognosis, defined as mortality or ICU transfer, of new onset organ failure. From included studies, bibliographical and study description data, patient characteristics, and data related to prevalence of organ failure and prognosis will be extracted. We will assess risk of bias in included studies using the Quality in Prognosis Studies tool for prognostic studies and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for observational studies. We expect heterogeneity and to conduct a qualitative synthesis of the results. If, however, heterogeneity is low, we will conduct a random effects meta-analysis stratified by basic study design. DISCUSSION: This review will summarize and analyze studies of prevalence and prognosis of acutely ill patients, with organ failure at arrival to hospital, assist ED physicians assessing the risk of organ failure in unselected patients, and guide recommendations for further research.

We systematically reviewed the literature to identify the efficacy and implementation challenges of telemedicine systems in ambulances. METHODS: A search for published studies on Web of Science and PubMed was completed. Studies were selected if they included at least a pilot study and they focused on feasibility or implementation of telemedicine systems in ambulances. RESULTS: A total of 864 articles were used for title and abstract screening. Full text screening was completed for 102 articles, with 23 being selected for final review. Sixty-one percent of the studies included in the review focused on general emergency care, while 26% focused on stroke care and 13% focused on myocardial infarction care. The reviewed studies found that telemedicine is feasible and effective in decreasing treatment times, report a high diagnosis accuracy rate, show higher rates of positive task completion than in regular ambulances, and demonstrate that stroke evaluation is completed with comparable accuracy to the standard way of delivering care. CONCLUSIONS: Although this review identified life-saving benefits of telemedicine, it also showed the paucity of the scientifically sound research in its implementation, prompting further studies. Further research is needed to analyze the capabilities and challenges involved in implementing telemedicine in ambulances, especially studies focusing on human-system integration and human factors\' considerations in the implementation of telemedicine systems in ambulances, the development of advanced Internet connectivity paradigms, additional applications for triaging, and the implications of ambulance location.','Rogers H and Madathil KC and Agnisarman S and Narasimha S and Ashok A and Nair A and Welch BM and McElligott JT','Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association',NULL,'Ambulances/economics/*organization & administration,Electrocardiography,Humans,Myocardial Infarction/diagnosis/therapy,Remote Consultation/economics/*instrumentation/*organization &,administration/standards,Stroke/diagnosis/therapy,Time-to-Treatment,Vital Signs'),(167,2,'29972864','29972864','Predicting Post-Thrombotic Syndrome with Ultrasonographic Follow-Up after Deep Vein Thrombosis: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.','BACKGROUND: Post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) is a common and potential severe complication of deep venous thrombosis (DVT). Elastic compression stocking therapy may prevent PTS if worn on a daily basis, but stockings are cumbersome to apply and uncomfortable to wear. Hence, identification of predictors of PTS may help physicians to select patients at high risk of PTS. AIMS: This article identifies ultrasonography (US) parameters assessed during or after treatment of DVT of the leg, that predict PTS. METHODS: This is a systematic review and meta-analysis study. Databases were searched for prospective studies including consecutive patients with DVT who received standardized treatment, had an US during follow-up assessing findings consistent with vascular damage after DVT and had a follow-up period of at least 6 months for the occurrence of PTS assessed by a standardized protocol. RESULTS: The literature search revealed 1,156 studies of which 1,068 were irrelevant after title and abstract screening by three independent reviewers. After full-text screening, 12 relevant studies were included, with a total of 2,684 analysed patients. Two US parameters proved to be predictive of PTS: residual vein thrombosis, for a pooled odds ratio (OR) of 2.17 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.79-2.63) and venous reflux at the popliteal level, for a pooled OR of 1.34 (95% CI, 1.03-1.75). CONCLUSION: The US features reflux and residual thrombosis measured at least 6 weeks after DVT predict PTS. Whether these features may be used to identify patients who may benefit from compression therapy remains to be assessed in further studies.','Dronkers CEA and Mol GC and Maraziti G and van de Ree MA and Huisman MV and Becattini C and Klok FA','Thrombosis and haemostasis',NULL,'Aged,Clinical Decision-Making,Female,Humans,Male,Middle Aged,Patient Selection,Postthrombotic Syndrome/*etiology/prevention & control,Predictive Value of Tests,Prognosis,Reproducibility of Results,Risk Assessment,Risk Factors,Stockings, Compression,Time Factors,*Ultrasonography,Venous Thrombosis/*complications/*diagnostic imaging/therapy'),(168,2,'28502603','28502603','Alcohol consumption for simulated driving performance: A systematic review.','PURPOSE: Alcohol consumption can lead to risky driving and increase the frequency of traffic accidents, injuries and mortalities. The main purpose of our study was to compare simulated driving performance between two groups of drivers, one consumed alcohol and the other not consumed, using a systematic review. METHODS: In this systematic review, electronic resources and databases including Medline via Ovid SP, EMBASE via Ovid SP, PsycINFO via Ovid SP, PubMed, Scopus, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINHAL) via EBSCOhost were comprehensively and systematically searched. The randomized controlled clinical trials that compared simulated driving performance between two groups of drivers, one consumed alcohol and the other not consumed, were included. Lane position standard deviation (LPSD), mean of lane position deviation (MLPD), speed, mean of speed deviation (MSD), standard deviation of speed deviation (SDSD), number of accidents (NA) and line crossing (LC) were considered as the main parameters evaluating outcomes. After title and abstract screening, the articles were enrolled for data extraction and they were evaluated for risk of biases. RESULTS: Thirteen papers were included in our qualitative synthesis. All included papers were classified as high risk of biases. Alcohol consumption mostly deteriorated the following performance outcomes in descending order: SDSD, LPSD, speed, MLPD, LC and NA. Our systematic review had troublesome heterogeneity. CONCLUSION: Alcohol consumption may decrease simulated driving performance in alcohol consumed people compared with non-alcohol consumed people via changes in SDSD, LPSD, speed, MLPD, LC and NA.

Here we present Phenotero, a freely available and simple solution to annotate patient phenotypes and diseases at the time of writing clinical reports or manuscripts. We adopt Zotero, a citation management software to create a tool which allows to reference classes from ontologies within text at the time of writing. We expect this approach to decrease the additional workload to a minimum while ensuring high quality associations with ontology classes. Standardized collection of phenotypic information at the time of describing the patient allows for streamlining the clinic workflow and efficient data entry. It will subsequently promote clinical and molecular diagnosis with the ultimate goal of better understanding genetic diseases.

The aim of this literature review was to review and resume the most recent recommendations for ICG use in its plastic surgery applications. METHODS: A systematic literature review was performed using Medline, EMBASE, and PubMed databases to obtain the latest recommendations for ICG in plastic surgery. Inclusion criteria were all articles written in English language that evaluated pre-, intra-, or postoperative ICG applications in surgical procedures usually performed by plastic surgeons. Case reports, reviews, meta-analyses, and experimental studies on animals or cadavers were excluded after title and abstract screening. RESULTS: Of the 1389 article titles retrieved, 41 full-text articles met the inclusion criteria. ICG applications in plastic surgery were ICG lymphangiography used in sentinel lymph node mapping for breast cancer and melanoma and in microsurgery for the staging and treatment of secondary chronic lymphedema. The latest updates of ICG angiography in assessing free flaps, pedicled flaps, or large skin paddles were also retrieved. CONCLUSIONS: Large prospective studies suggest that ICG lymphography could be used as a single tracer to reliably perform sentinel lymph node biopsy. In the case of cutaneous melanoma, ICG lymphography increases node detection sensitivity and accuracy in conjunction with lymphoscintigraphy. In chronic lymphedema, it is useful for pre- and postoperative staging and intraoperative anatomical location of lymphatic pathways when lymphovenous bypass is indicated. ICG angiography is used intraoperatively to assess free flap anastomosis and design skin paddles and postoperatively to monitor buried flaps. In pedicled perforator flaps or for large skin paddles, intraoperative ICG angiography is strongly correlated with postoperative outcomes.

A total of 10 studies that compared the effects of self-selected and imposed exercise sessions on acute FS responses were included. The screening strategy included: exclusion of studies that were duplicated between databases, abstract screening, and text screening. The standardized mean difference (SMD) between self-selected and imposed exercise sessions categorized in five intensities (equal intensity: both exercises were performed at the same intensity, below lactate/ventilatory threshold (LT/VT): imposed exercise was performed at an intensity below the LT/VT, at LT/VT: imposed exercise was performed at the LT/VT intensity, above LT/VT: imposed exercise was performed at an intensity above the LT/VT, and different intensity: both exercises were performed at different intensities and the intensity of imposed session was not reported relative to LT/VT) and an overall SMD were calculated. Self-selected exercise was used as the reference condition. The subtotal SMD values were as follows: -0.10 (equal intensity), -0.36 (below LT/VT), -0.57 (at LT/VT), -1.30 (above LT/VT), and -0.09 (different intensity) and the overall SMD was -0.41.

Comprehensive national registries of patients with end-stage kidney disease who are undergoing dialysis provide a unique opportunity to compare trial and real-world patient cohorts. Objective: To determine if participants in large, multicenter dialysis trials were similar to the general population undergoing dialysis in terms of age, comorbidities, and mortality rate. Data Sources: MEDLINE, PubMed, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were systematically searched on January 6, 2017, for studies published from January 1, 2007, to December 31, 2016. Data sources were published manuscripts, supplementary material, and trial registration information. Data on the general population undergoing dialysis were derived from the US Renal Data System (USRDS). Data were analyzed from March 17 to July 22, 2018. Study Selection: Randomized clinical trials enrolling only participants undergoing dialysis for end-stage kidney disease with 100 or more adult participants from 2 or more sites. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Abstract screening and data extraction were performed independently by 2 researchers. Data were pooled using a random-effects model. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was difference in mean age between the RCT and USRDS populations. Secondary outcomes included differences in mortality rate and comorbidities. Results: The search identified 189 RCTs, enrolling 80104 participants. Compared with the 2011 USRDS population, RCT participants were younger (mean age, 58.9 years; 95% CI, 58.3-59.5 years vs 61.2 years; P < .001), more likely to be male (58.8%; 95% CI, 57.5%-60.0% vs 55.7%; P < .001), and have coronary artery disease (26.7%; 95% CI, 22.1%-31.4% vs 17.7%; P < .001) and less likely to have diabetes (40.4%; 95% CI, 36.9%-43.8% vs 44.2%; P = .04) or heart failure (19.9%; 95% CI, 15.6%-24.3% vs 29.8%; P < .001). The mortality rate per 100 patient-years during trial participation was less than half that of the USRDS population (8.9; 95% CI, 7.9-10.0 vs 18.6; P < .001). The differences in age, mortality, and coronary artery disease remained when studies recruiting only from the United States were considered. Diabetes was more common in RCT participants from the United States than in the registry population. Conclusions and Relevance: Participants in large, multicenter RCTs of patients with end-stage kidney disease undergoing dialysis are younger, have a different pattern of comorbidities, and have a lower mortality rate than the general population of patients undergoing dialysis. This finding has implications for the generalization of trial results to the broader patient population and for future trial design.','Smyth B and Haber A and Trongtrakul K and Hawley C and Perkovic V and Woodward M and Jardine M','JAMA internal medicine',NULL,''),(174,2,'28977093','28977093','Urinary EN-2 to predict prostate cancer: Systematic review and meta-analysis.','INTRODUCTION: Prostate cancer is the second type of cancer diagnosed and the fifth cause of death in men worldwide.

SOURCES: MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, LILACS, BBO Library, Cochrane Library and SIGLE were searched without restrictions, as well as the abstracts of the annual conference of the IADR and the trials registry. Dissertations and theses were searched using the ProQuest Dissertations and Periodicos Capes Theses databases. STUDY SELECTION: We included randomised clinical trials (RCTs) that compared the retention rates restorations in NCCLs placed with or without bevel with at least 1-year follow-up. The risk of bias tool of the Cochrane Collaboration was used for quality assessment. DATA: After duplicate removal, 1356 articles were identified. After abstract screening, 14 studies remained and this number was reduced to four after examination of the full-texts. Only two were considered to have a \'low\' risk of bias. The overall risk difference was 0.0 (95% CI -0.04 to 0.04) for the retention rate (p=0.91) and 0.05 (-0.02 to 0.13) for the marginal discolouration (p=0.17). CONCLUSIONS: No superiority of bevelled restorations was observed in the short-term follow-up of 1-year, although this conclusion was based on only two RCTs. There is not enough evidence to support the bevelled technique over non-bevelled for NCCLs over longer periods of time. Better standardization and reporting of RCTs of enamel bevelling are necessary in longer-term follow-ups.

DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES: CINAHL, Cochrane, Embase, HMIC, Medline/PubMed and PsycINFO, from 1997 to 2017. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Randomised trials focusing on adult subjects, testing an intervention consisting of sharing EHRs with patients, and with an outcome in one of the six domains of quality of care. DATA ANALYSIS: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were followed. Title and abstract screening were performed by two pairs of investigators and assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. For each domain, a narrative synthesis of the results was performed, and significant differences in results between low risk and high/unclear risk of bias studies were tested (t-test, p<0.05). Continuous outcomes evaluated in four studies or more (glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP)) were pooled as weighted mean difference (WMD) using random effects meta-analysis. Sensitivity analyses were performed for low risk of bias studies, and long-term interventions only (lasting more than 12 months). RESULTS: Twenty studies were included (17 387 participants). The domain most frequently assessed was effectiveness (n=14), and the least were timeliness and equity (n=0). Inconsistent results were found for patient-centredness outcomes (ie, satisfaction, activation, self-efficacy, empowerment or health literacy), with 54.5% of the studies (n=6) demonstrating a beneficial effect. Meta-analyses showed a beneficial effect in effectiveness by reducing absolute values of HbA1c (unit: %; WMD=-0.316; 95% CI -0.540 to -0.093, p=0.005, I(2)=0%), which remained significant in the sensitivity analyses for low risk of bias studies (WMD= -0.405; 95% CI -0.711 to -0.099), and long-term interventions only (WMD=-0.272; 95% CI -0.482 to -0.062). A significant reduction of absolute values of SBP (unit: mm Hg) was found but lost in sensitivity analysis for studies with low risk of bias (WMD= -1.375; 95% CI -2.791 to 0.041). No significant effect was found for DBP (unit: mm Hg; WMD=-0.918; 95% CI -2.078 to 0.242, p=0.121, I(2)=0%). Concerning efficiency, most studies (80%, n=4) found either a reduction of healthcare usage or no change. A beneficial effect was observed in a range of safety outcomes (ie, general adherence, medication safety), but not in medication adherence. The proportion of studies reporting a beneficial effect did not differ between low risk and high/unclear risk studies, for the domains evaluated. DISCUSSION: Our analysis supports that sharing EHRs with patients is effective in reducing HbA1c levels, a major predictor of mortality in type 2 diabetes (mean decrease of -0.405, unit: %) and could improve patient safety. More studies are necessary to enhance meta-analytical power and assess the impact in other domains of care.

Surgical therapy of the diaphragm should be performed after clinical stabilization of the neonate. Higher hospital or surgeon volume has previously been found to be associated with better clinical outcomes for different especially high-risk, low-volume procedures. Therefore, we aim to examine the relationship between hospital or surgeon volume and outcomes for congenital diaphragmatic hernia. METHODS: This systematic review protocol has been designed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Protocol. We will perform a systematic literature search in MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and Biosis Previews without applying any limitations. In addition, we will search for relevant conference abstracts. We will screen titles and abstracts of retrieved studies, obtain potentially relevant full texts, and assess the eligibility of those full texts against our inclusion criteria. We will include comparative studies analyzing the relationship between hospital or surgeon volume and clinical outcomes. We will systematically assess risk of bias of included studies and extract data on the study design, patient characteristics, case-mix adjustments, statistical methods, hospital and surgeon volume, and outcomes into standardized tables. Title and abstract screening, full-text screening, critical appraisal, and data extraction of results will be conducted by two reviewers independently. Other data will be extracted by one reviewer and checked for accuracy by a second one. Any disagreements will be resolved by discussion.

In health care, these smart textile systems present the potential to aid preventative medicine and early diagnosis through continuous, noninvasive tracking of physical and mental health while promoting proactive involvement of patients in their medical management. In areas such as sports and emergency response, the potential to provide comprehensive and simultaneous physiological insights across multiple body systems is promising. However, it is currently unclear what type of evidence exists surrounding the use of smart textiles for the monitoring of physiological outcome measures across different settings. OBJECTIVE: This scoping review aimed to systematically survey the existing body of scientific literature surrounding smart textiles in their most prevalent form, the smart shirt, for monitoring physiological outcome measures. METHODS: A total of 5 electronic bibliographic databases were systematically searched (Ovid Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online, Excerpta Medica database, Scopus, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and SPORTDiscus). Publications from the inception of the database to June 24, 2019 were reviewed. Nonindexed literature relevant to this review was also systematically searched. The results were then collated, summarized, and reported. RESULTS: Following the removal of duplicates, 7871 citations were identified. On the basis of title and abstract screening, 7632 citations were excluded, whereas 239 were retrieved and assessed for eligibility. Of these, 101 citations were included in the final analysis. Included studies were categorized into four themes: (1) prototype design, (2) validation, (3) observational, and (4) reviews. Among the 101 analyzed studies, prototype design was the most prevalent theme (50/101, 49.5%), followed by validation (29/101, 28.7%), observational studies (21/101, 20.8%), and reviews (1/101, 0.1%). Presented prototype designs ranged from those capable of monitoring one physiological metric to those capable of monitoring several simultaneously. In 29 validation studies, 16 distinct smart shirts were validated against reference technology under various conditions and work rates, including rest, submaximal exercise, and maximal exercise. The identified observational studies used smart shirts in clinical, healthy, and occupational populations for aims such as early diagnosis and stress detection. One scoping review was identified, investigating the use of smart shirts for electrocardiograph signal monitoring in cardiac patients. CONCLUSIONS: Although smart shirts have been found to be valid and reliable in the monitoring of specific physiological metrics, results were variable for others, demonstrating the need for further systematic validation. Analysis of the results has also demonstrated gaps in knowledge, such as a considerable lag of validation and observational studies in comparison with prototype design and limited investigation using smart shirts in pediatric, elite sports, and emergency service populations.','Khundaqji H and Hing W and Furness J and Climstein M','JMIR mHealth and uHealth',NULL,''),(180,2,'27412354','27412354','Knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, values, preferences, and feasibility in relation to the use of injection safety devices in healthcare settings: a systematic review.','BACKGROUND: Adopting technologies such as injection safety devices in healthcare settings can enhance injection safety. Developing guidelines for appropriate adoption of such technologies need to consider factors beyond evidence for their health effects. The objective of this study is to systematically review the published literature for evidence among healthcare workers and patients about knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, values, preferences, and feasibility in relation to the use of injection safety devices in healthcare settings. METHODS: We included both qualitative and quantitative studies conducted with the general public, patients, and healthcare workers, administrators, or policy makers. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINHAL and CENTRAL. We used a duplicate and independent approach to title and abstract screening, full text screening, data abstraction and risk of bias assessment. RESULTS: Out of a total of 6568 identified citations, we judged fourteen studies as eligible for this systematic review. All these studies were surveys, conducted with healthcare workers in high-income countries. We did not identify any qualitative study, or a study of the general public, patients, healthcare administrators or policy makers. We did not identify any study assessing knowledge, or values assigned to outcomes relevant to injection safety devices. Each of the included studies suffered from methodological limitations, which lowers our confidence in their findings. Based on the findings of six studies, the injection safety devices were generally perceived as easy to use and as an improvement compared with conventional syringes. Some of these studies reported few technical problems while using the devices. In three studies assessing perceived safety, the majority of participants judged the devices as safe. Two studies reported positive perceptions of healthcare workers regarding patient tolerance of these injection safety devices. One study found that less than half the nurses felt comfortable using the insulin pens. Findings from four studies assessing preference and satisfaction were not consistent. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review identified evidence that injection safety devices are generally perceived as easy to use, safe, and tolerated by patients. There were few reports of technical problems while using the devices and some discomfort by nurses using the insulin pens.','Tarabay R and El Rassi R and Dakik A and Harb A and Ballout RA and Diab B and Khamassi S and Akl EA','Health and quality of life outcomes',NULL,'Attitude of Health Personnel,Feasibility Studies,*Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice,Humans,*Injections,Patient Preference,Patient Satisfaction,*Protective Devices,Qualitative Research'),(181,2,'32646820','32646820','Do Exercises Prevent Falls Among Older Adults: Where Are We Now?

METHODS: PubMed, Scopus, MEDLINE, and Cochrane were searched with restrictions applied to publication year (20152019) and language (limited to studies published in English). After duplicate removal and title and abstract screening, 2 authors independently identified eligible studies on the basis of inclusion criteria. Risk of bias and quality of evidence were assessed. RESULTS: Thirty-four studies were included after screening titles and abstracts from 855 citations and 129 full-text articles. Thirteen randomized-controlled trials and clinical trials (5 on MI, 1 on MCI, and 7 on SI) including 2232 participants and 21 systematic reviews (assessing SI, MI, MCI, or all) were extracted for qualitative synthesis. Fifteen out of 20 studies that reported outcomes on falls rate found a significant reduction. Seventeen out of 23 studies with outcomes on fall risk factors concluded a significant improvement. Five studies found no significant differences in falls incidence, and 5 studies found no significant differences in fall risks. One study reported worsened outcomes, including poorer balance. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Although results are inconclusive, SI, MI, and MCI involving exercises may prevent falls. Vitamin D supplementation may be beneficial alongside exercise; however, whether vitamin D use consistently reduces falls incidence or fall risks remains uncertain. Exercises that are individually tailored to participants\' capabilities and risks may be the most effective falls prevention interventions. Implementation may reduce medical costs and improve quality of life for older adults who are community-dwelling or are living in long-term care facilities.','Senderovich H and Tsai PM','Journal of the American Medical Directors Association',NULL,''),(182,2,'26073974','26073974','Faster title and abstract screening? Evaluating Abstrackr, a semi-automated online screening program for systematic reviewers.','BACKGROUND: Citation screening is time consuming and inefficient. We sought to evaluate the performance of Abstrackr, a semi-automated online tool for predictive title and abstract screening. METHODS: Four systematic reviews (aHUS, dietary fibre, ECHO, rituximab) were used to evaluate Abstrackr. Citations from electronic searches of biomedical databases were imported into Abstrackr, and titles and abstracts were screened and included or excluded according to the entry criteria. This process was continued until Abstrackr predicted and classified the remaining unscreened citations as relevant or irrelevant. These classification predictions were checked for accuracy against the original review decisions. Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the effects of including case reports in the aHUS dataset whilst screening and the effects of using larger imbalanced datasets with the ECHO dataset. The performance of Abstrackr was calculated according to the number of relevant studies missed, the workload saving, the false negative rate, and the precision of the algorithm to correctly predict relevant studies for inclusion, i.e. further full text inspection. RESULTS: Of the unscreened citations, Abstrackr\'s prediction algorithm correctly identified all relevant citations for the rituximab and dietary fibre reviews. However, one relevant citation in both the aHUS and ECHO reviews was incorrectly predicted as not relevant. The workload saving achieved with Abstrackr varied depending on the complexity and size of the reviews (9 % rituximab, 40 % dietary fibre, 67 % aHUS, and 57 % ECHO). The proportion of citations predicted as relevant, and therefore, warranting further full text inspection (i.e. the precision of the prediction) ranged from 16 % (aHUS) to 45 % (rituximab) and was affected by the complexity of the reviews. The false negative rate ranged from 2.4 to 21.7 %. Sensitivity analysis performed on the aHUS dataset increased the precision from 16 to 25 % and increased the workload saving by 10 % but increased the number of relevant studies missed. Sensitivity analysis performed with the larger ECHO dataset increased the workload saving (80 %) but reduced the precision (6.8 %) and increased the number of missed citations. CONCLUSIONS: Semi-automated title and abstract screening with Abstrackr has the potential to save time and reduce research waste.','Rathbone J and Hoffmann T and Glasziou P','Systematic reviews',NULL,'*Abstracting and Indexing,*Algorithms,Humans,Reproducibility of Results,*Review Literature as Topic,Sensitivity and Specificity'),(183,2,'32768446','32768446','Clinical Concept Extraction: a Methodology Review.','BACKGROUND: Concept extraction, a subdomain of natural language processing (NLP) with a focus on extracting concepts of interest, has been adopted to computationally extract clinical information from text for a wide range of applications ranging from clinical decision support to care quality improvement.

Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) represents one subtype and is thought to account for up to 16% of all degenerative dementias. Although the core of the diagnostic process in dementia rests firmly on clinical and cognitive assessments, a wide range of investigations are available to aid diagnosis.Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is an established clinical tool that uses an intravenously injected radiolabelled tracer to map blood flow in the brain. In FTD the characteristic pattern seen is hypoperfusion of the frontal and anterior temporal lobes. This pattern of blood flow is different to patterns seen in other subtypes of dementia and so can be used to differentiate FTD.It has been proposed that a diagnosis of FTD, (particularly early stage), should be made not only on the basis of clinical criteria but using a combination of other diagnostic findings, including rCBF SPECT. However, more extensive testing comes at a financial cost, and with a potential risk to patient safety and comfort. OBJECTIVES: To determine the diagnostic accuracy of rCBF SPECT for diagnosing FTD in populations with suspected dementia in secondary/tertiary healthcare settings and in the differential diagnosis of FTD from other dementia subtypes. SEARCH METHODS: Our search strategy used two concepts: (a) the index test and (b) the condition of interest. We searched citation databases, including MEDLINE (Ovid SP), EMBASE (Ovid SP), BIOSIS (Ovid SP), Web of Science Core Collection (ISI Web of Science), PsycINFO (Ovid SP), CINAHL (EBSCOhost) and LILACS (Bireme), using structured search strategies appropriate for each database. In addition we searched specialised sources of diagnostic test accuracy studies and reviews including: MEDION (Universities of Maastricht and Leuven), DARE (Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects) and HTA (Health Technology Assessment) database.We requested a search of the Cochrane Register of Diagnostic Test Accuracy Studies and used the related articles feature in PubMed to search for additional studies. We tracked key studies in citation databases such as Science Citation Index and Scopus to ascertain any further relevant studies. We identified \'grey\' literature, mainly in the form of conference abstracts, through the Web of Science Core Collection, including Conference Proceedings Citation Index and Embase. The most recent search for this review was run on the 1 June 2013.Following title and abstract screening of the search results, full-text papers were obtained for each potentially eligible study. These papers were then independently evaluated for inclusion or exclusion. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included both case-control and cohort (delayed verification of diagnosis) studies. Where studies used a case-control design we included all participants who had a clinical diagnosis of FTD or other dementia subtype using standard clinical diagnostic criteria. For cohort studies, we included studies where all participants with suspected dementia were administered rCBF SPECT at baseline. We excluded studies of participants from selected populations (e.g. post-stroke) and studies of participants with a secondary cause of cognitive impairment. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors extracted information on study characteristics and data for the assessment of methodological quality and the investigation of heterogeneity. We assessed the methodological quality of each study using the QUADAS-2 (Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies) tool. We produced a narrative summary describing numbers of studies that were found to have high/low/unclear risk of bias as well as concerns regarding applicability. To produce 2 x 2 tables, we dichotomised the rCBF SPECT results (scan positive or negative for FTD) and cross-tabulated them against the results for the reference standard. These tables were then used to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of the index test. Meta-analysis was not performed due to the considerable between-study variation in clinical and methodological characteristics. MAIN RESULTS: Eleven studies (1117 participants) met our inclusion criteria. These consisted of six case-control studies, two retrospective cohort studies and three prospective cohort studies. Three studies used single-headed camera SPECT while the remaining eight used multiple-headed camera SPECT. Study design and methods varied widely. Overall, participant selection was not well described and the studies were judged as having either high or unclear risk of bias. Often the threshold used to define a positive SPECT result was not predefined and the results were reported with knowledge of the reference standard. Concerns regarding applicability of the studies to the review question were generally low across all three domains (participant selection, index test and reference standard).Sensitivities and specificities for differentiating FTD from non-FTD ranged from 0.73 to 1.00 and from 0.80 to 1.00, respectively, for the three multiple-headed camera studies. Sensitivities were lower for the two single-headed camera studies; one reported a sensitivity and specificity of 0.40 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.05 to 0.85) and 0.95 (95% CI 0.90 to 0.98), respectively, and the other a sensitivity and specificity of 0.36 (95% CI 0.24 to 0.50) and 0.92 (95% CI 0.88 to 0.95), respectively.Eight of the 11 studies which used SPECT to differentiate FTD from Alzheimer\'s disease used multiple-headed camera SPECT. Of these studies, five used a case-control design and reported sensitivities of between 0.52 and 1.00, and specificities of between 0.41 and 0.86. The remaining three studies used a cohort design and reported sensitivities of between 0.73 and 1.00, and specificities of between 0.94 and 1.00. The three studies that used single-headed camera SPECT reported sensitivities of between 0.40 and 0.80, and specificities of between 0.61 and 0.97. AUTHORS\' CONCLUSIONS: At present, we would not recommend the routine use of rCBF SPECT in clinical practice because there is insufficient evidence from the available literature to support this.Further research into the use of rCBF SPECT for differentiating FTD from other dementias is required. In particular, protocols should be standardised, study populations should be well described, the threshold for \'abnormal\' scans predefined and clear details given on how scans are analysed. More prospective cohort studies that verify the presence or absence of FTD during a period of follow up should be undertaken.','Archer HA and Smailagic N and John C and Holmes RB and Takwoingi Y and Coulthard EJ and Cullum S','The Cochrane database of systematic reviews',NULL,'Case-Control Studies,*Cerebrovascular Circulation,Cohort Studies,Dementia/diagnostic imaging,Diagnosis, Differential,Frontal Lobe/blood supply,Frontotemporal Dementia/*diagnostic imaging/physiopathology,Humans,Sensitivity and Specificity,Temporal Lobe/blood supply,Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon/*methods'),(185,2,'31666268','31666268','Interventions to integrate care for people with serious mental illness and substance use disorders: a systematic scoping review protocol.','INTRODUCTION: People with serious mental illness (SMI) and/or substance use disorders (SUDs) have an elevated risk of premature mortality compared with the general population. This has been attributed to higher rates of chronic illness among these individuals, but also to inequities in healthcare access and treatment. Integrated care has the potential to improve the health of people with SMI/SUDs. The aims of this scoping review are to: (1) identify empirical investigations of interventions designed to integrate care for people with SMI/SUDs; (2) describe the underlying theories, models and frameworks of integrated care that informed their development; and (3) determine the degree to which interventions address dimensions of a comprehensive and validated framework of integrated care. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Guidelines for best practice and reporting of scoping reviews will be followed using the framework of Arksey and O\'Malley and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses scoping review checklist. An iterative and systematic search of peer-reviewed publications reporting empirical research findings will be conducted. This literature will be identified by searching five databases: Medline (Ovid), PsycINFO, CINAHL, Embase (Ovid) and Scopus. The search will be restricted to articles published between January 2000 and April 2019. Two reviewers will independently screen publications in two successive stages of title and abstract screening, followed by full-text screening of eligible publications. A tabular summary and narrative synthesis will be completed using data extracted from each included study. A framework synthesis will also be conducted, with descriptions of interventions mapped against a theoretical framework of integrated care.

Little is known about how health equity and population vulnerability are defined and measured in research focused on task shifting. This systematic review will address the following questions: Among task shifting interventions in high-income settings that have been studied using randomised controlled trials or variants, how are health inequity or population vulnerability identified and defined? What methods and indicators are used to describe, characterise and measure the population\'s baseline status and the intervention\'s impacts on inequity and vulnerability? METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Studies were identified through database searches (MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO and Web of Science). Eligible studies will be randomised controlled trials published since 2004, conducted in high-income countries, concerning task shifting interventions to treat any disease, in any population that may face health disadvantage as defined by the PROGRESS-Plus framework (place of residence, race/ethnicity/culture/language, occupation, gender/sex, religion, social capital, socioeconomic position, age, disability, sexual orientation, other vulnerable groups). We will conduct independent and duplicate title and abstract screening, then identify related papers from the same programme of research through further database and manual searching. From each programme of research, we will extract study details, and definitions and measures of health equity or population vulnerability based on the PROGRESS-Plus framework. Two investigators will assess the quality of reporting and measurement related to health equity and vulnerability using a scale developed for this study.

A variety of barriers entrenched in the traditional drug distribution and dispensing model of pharmacy business has continued to challenge the implementation efforts of medication review services worldwide in the community pharmacy setting. MAIN OBJECTIVES: i) Characterize original research studies that sought to enhance medication review service implementation in community pharmacy settings. ii) Categorize the broader corpus of scientific literature (beyond original implementation studies) on medication review service implementation in community pharmacy settings. METHODS: A broad systematic search strategy was applied to ovid MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and Cochrane Library to create an over-arching view and extensively ordered bibliography of the diverse research publication types dealing with the topic of medication review service implementation in the community pharmacy setting. A scoping review was subsequently conducted on original research studies that utilized various strategies to enhance the implementation of this service in community pharmacies. Data-charting evaluated the location of implementation studies, the strategies undertaken, the scale of implementation strategies, the use of DII (Dissemination, Implementation and Improvement) science theory, sample sizes, and DII outcomes. RESULTS: Of 5947 records screened, 419 fulfilled the inclusion criteria (from abstract screening) to be deemed suitable for categorization and inclusion into the broader survey on this topic. Of these 419 publications, only 75 were original research specifically focused on enhancing the implementation of medication reviews in community pharmacy. A large majority of the publications were qualitative studies (n=203). The remaining articles were improvement studies (n=36), descriptive observational studies (n=49), reviews (n=69) and methodology papers (n=16). Twenty-nine of these articles were deemed suitable for inclusion in more than one category. After full-text screening, 41 of the 75 implementation publications, representing 40 original studies, published between 1999 and 2019, were eligible for data-charting. The majority of these studies occurred in North America (n=30), used some form of education as the most common implementation strategy (n=22) and measured \'adoption\' (extent or frequency of medication reviews delivered) most frequently as an implementation outcome (n=30). Just over half of the studies used a multi-faceted implementation strategy (n=21). Only 9 studies used a theory, model or framework at any point in the research process to test hypotheses or explain empirical findings. CONCLUSIONS: There is an abundance of publications addressing various issues surrounding medication review implementation in community pharmacies. However, the literature appears disproportionately represented by qualitative studies. There is also a need for more rigorously conducted implementation studies on medication review services in community pharmacy.','Brandt J and Le ML and Jantscher S and Bricelj A and Louizos C and Ng S and Sibley K','Research in social & administrative pharmacy : RSAP',NULL,''),(189,2,'29735347','29735347','Systematic assessment of decision analytic models for the cost-effectiveness of bariatric surgery for morbid obesity.','Bariatric surgery among patients with morbid obesity is very effective for providing long-term weight loss and remission of obesity-related co-morbidities. However, it is very expensive and its cost effectiveness is commonly argued. Long-term cost-effectiveness evaluations of bariatric surgery have often relied on decision models. A systematic review was performed on the methodologic approaches and their quality, evaluated the quality of reporting, and summarized findings and conclusions in published cost-effectiveness models of bariatric surgery for morbid obesity. A search from different databases with an end date of October 15, 2017 was completed. The initial search for title and abstract screening resulted in 741 articles. A total of 50 articles were included for full-text review and 23 economic evaluation studies were included in the systematic review.

Sixty-one percent of studies defined their health states by the existence or absence of different obesity-related co-morbidities. Eleven percent of studies took the societal perspective. Most studies (61%) used a lifetime horizon. Thirty-nine percent of studies identified the extent of weight loss as the most sensitive and influential parameter. Seventeen (74%) did not report a formal model validation. Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass was reported as the most cost-effective strategy most often when it compared with no treatment or medical management.

Citation screening is a key step in the systematic review process. An opportunity to improve the efficiency of systematic review production involves the use of non-expert groups and new technologies for citation screening. We performed a pilot study of citation screening by medical students using four screening methods and compared students\' performance to experienced review authors. METHODS: The aims of this pilot randomised controlled trial were to provide preliminary data on the accuracy of title and abstract screening by medical students, and on the effect of screening modality on screening accuracy and efficiency. Medical students were randomly allocated to title and abstract screening using one of the four modalities and required to screen 650 citations from a single systematic review update. The four screening modalities were a reference management software program (EndNote), Paper, a web-based systematic review workflow platform (ReGroup) and a mobile screening application (Screen2Go). Screening sensitivity and specificity were analysed in a complete case analysis using a chi-squared test and Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test according to screening modality and compared to a final set of included citations selected by expert review authors. RESULTS: Sensitivity of medical students\' screening decisions ranged from 46.7% to 66.7%, with students using the web-based platform performing significantly better than the paper-based group. Specificity ranged from 93.2% to 97.4% with the lowest specificity seen with the web-based platform. There was no significant difference in performance between the other three modalities. CONCLUSIONS: Medical students are a feasible population to engage in citation screening. Future studies should investigate the effect of incentive systems, training and support and analytical methods on screening performance.

Methods: Adhering to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, 5 databases were searched using predefined search terms. Following title and abstract screening of 1115 records, the removal of duplicates (n=584) and articles that did not meet the inclusion criteria agreed to a priori (n=419) resulted in 112 records that were full-text screened. Two independent reviewers subsequently used the mixed-methods appraisal tool to assess the methodological quality of 57 full-text studies that met the inclusion criteria after full-text screening. The interventions were summarised using the TIDierR checklist and TEO. The strength of evidence was determined using a 5-level rating system utilising a published decision tree. Results: Overall evidence ratings for interventions implemented within school settings were: no evidence of effects on moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and inconclusive evidence of effects on sedentary time. In relation to the TEO, expansion of PA appeared to be the most promising intervention type for MVPA, with moderate evidence of effect, whereas extension and enhancement of PA opportunity demonstrated no evidence of effect. A critical issue of possible compensatory behavior was identified by analysis of intervention effect in relation to PA measurement duration; when studies measured changes in PA during the actual intervention, there was moderate evidence of effect, whereas those that measured changes in PA during the school day presented inconclusive evidence of effect, and those that measured changes in PA over a whole day yielded no evidence of effect. Two meta-analyses of those studies using a whole-day accelerometer measure for MVPA or ST showed a significant but moderate effect for MVPA (effect size=0.51; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.02-0.99) and a large but nonsignificant effect for ST (effect size=1.15; 95%CI: -1.03 to 3.33); both meta-analyses demonstrated low precision, considerable inconsistency, and high heterogeneity.

Electronic search strategies do not exhaustively retrieve them, because of issues related to indexing, exclusion of journals in languages other than English, among others. A handsearch approach is therefore warranted. We aimed to identify all CCTs published in Ophthalmology journals in Spain, to describe their main features, and to submit them to the Cochrane Register of CCTs (CENTRAL). METHODS: After identifying all Spanish Ophthalmology Journals, we conducted a systematic handsearch following Cochrane guidelines. When appropriate, results were compared against electronic searches. A descriptive analysis was completed, including risk of bias assessment. RESULTS: We identified 18 eligible journals; 10 074 original articles, editorials, letters to the editor, abstracts and conference proceedings were assessed via handsearching for inclusion. Of these, 136 were subject to title and abstract screening, after which 102 were classified as CCTs. We identified three articles via electronic searches that had not been detected via handsearch, for a total of 105 CCTs. Among these, the most investigated pathologies were cataracts (32/105; 30.5%) and glaucoma (23/105 21.9%). Regarding risk of bias, 104/105 (99.0%) were deemed as \"high risk of bias\", mainly due to flaws in sequence generation and allocation concealment. 15/105 (14.3%) mentioned conflicts of interest, half of which had something to declare. No CCT reported adherence to CONSORT. CONCLUSION: Spanish Ophthalmology journals publish a low number of CCTs, with limited methodological quality.

Following initial title and abstract screening, 2 authors independently reviewed full-text articles; a third settled disagreements. Two independent reviewers extracted data into a standardized form. Two authors independently assessed guideline quality using the AGREE II instrument; three generated summary recommendations based on the extracted guideline data. RESULTS: Overall, 16 articles were included in the final review. There was broad agreement on recommendations by the various organizations. For non-pharmacologic modalities, education/self-management, exercise, weight loss if overweight, walking aids as indicated, and thermal modalities were widely recommended. For appropriate patients, joint replacement was recommended; arthroscopy with debridement was not recommended for symptomatic knee OA. Pharmacologic modalities most recommended included acetaminophen/paracetamol (first line) and NSAIDs (topical or oral, second line).

Botulism must be rapidly identified and treated; however, clinical presentation and treatment outcomes of noninfant botulism in children are not well described. Methods: We searched 12 databases for peer-reviewed and non-peer-reviewed reports with primary data on botulism in children (persons <18 years of age) or botulinum antitoxin administration to children. Reports underwent title and abstract screening and full text review. For each case, patient demographic, clinical, and outcome data were abstracted. Results: Of 7065 reports identified, 184 met inclusion criteria and described 360 pediatric botulism cases (79% confirmed, 21% probable) that occurred during 1929-2015 in 34 countries. Fifty-three percent were male; age ranged from 4 months to 17 years (median, 10 years). The most commonly reported signs and symptoms were dysphagia (53%), dysarthria (39%), and generalized weakness (37%). Inpatient length of stay ranged from 1 to 425 days (median, 24 days); 14% of cases required intensive care unit admission; 25% reported mechanical ventilation. Eighty-three (23%) children died. Median interval from illness onset to death was 1 day (range, 0-260 days). Among patients who received antitoxin (n = 193), 23 (12%) reported an adverse event, including rash, fever, serum sickness, and anaphylaxis. Relative risk of death among patients treated with antitoxin compared with patients not treated with antitoxin was 0.24 (95% confidence interval, .14-.40; P < .0001). Conclusions: Dysphagia and dysarthria were the most commonly reported cranial nerve symptoms in children with botulism; generalized weakness was described more than paralysis. Children who received antitoxin had better survival; serious adverse events were rare. Most deaths occurred early in the clinical course; therefore, botulism in children should be identified and treated rapidly.','Griese SE and Kisselburgh HM and Bartenfeld MT and Thomas E and Rao AK and Sobel J and Dziuban EJ','Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America',NULL,'Adolescent,Botulinum Antitoxin/*therapeutic use,Botulism/diagnosis/*drug therapy,Child,Child, Preschool,Female,Humans,Immunologic Factors/*therapeutic use,Infant,Male'),(196,2,'31581808','31581808','Systematic review of cardiac rehabilitation guidelines: Quality and scope.','Cardiac rehabilitation is a comprehensive model of secondary prevention proven to reduce mortality and morbidity. The World Health Organization is developing a Package of Rehabilitation Interventions for implementation by ministries of health as part of universal healthcare across the continuum. Through a systematic review, we sought to identify the best-quality cardiac rehabilitation guidelines, and extract their recommendations for implementation by member states. A systematic search was undertaken of academic databases and guideline repositories, among other sources, through to April 2019, for English-language cardiac rehabilitation guidelines from the last 10 years, free from conflicts, and with strength of recommendations. Two authors independently considered all citations. Potentially eligible guidelines were rated for quality using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation tool, and for other characteristics such as being multi-professional, comprehensive and international in perspective; the latter criteria were used to inform selection of 3-5 guidelines meeting inclusion criteria. Equity considerations were also extracted. Altogether, 2076 unique citations were identified. Thirteen passed title and abstract screening, with six guidelines potentially eligible for inclusion in the Package of Rehabilitation Interventions and rated for quality; for two guidelines the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation tool ratings did not meet World Health Organization minimums. Of the four eligible guidelines, three were selected: the International Council of Cardiovascular Prevention and Rehabilitation (2016), National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (#172; 2013) and Scottish Intercollegiate Guideline Network (#150; 2017).

With this knowledge the growing number of clinicians restoring dental implants will have a better understanding of the available guidance and evidence base, and the differing levels of competence required.Study design A literature review was conducted. The selection of publications reporting on complexity was based on predetermined criteria and was agreed upon by the authors. After title and abstract screening 17 articles were reviewed. The articles that were utilised to form the ITI SAC tool and Cologne Risk Assessment we also included.Assessing complexity Two key guides are available: International Team for Implantology\'s Straight-forward Advanced Complex tool and the Cologne ABC risk score. While these guides help identify treatment complexity they do not provide a strong enough evidence base from which to solely base clinical decisions. The key patient factors are expectation, communication, the oral environment, aesthetic outcome, occlusion, soft tissue profile and the intra-arch distance, whereas the key technical factors are impression taking, type of retention, loading protocol and the need for provisional restorations. Human factors also have a significant effect on complexity, specifically, the experience and training of the clinician, team communication and the work environment.Conclusions There are many interconnecting factors that affect the complexity of dental implant restoration. Furthermore the two widely used indices for the assessment of complexity have been investigated, and although these offer a good guideline as to the level of complexity, there is a lack evidence to support their use. The development of evidence-based treatment and protocols is necessary to develop the current indices further, and these need to be expanded to include other critical areas, such as human factors. A practical guide to aid practitioners in reducing complexity has been proposed.','Wright SP and Hayden J and Lynd JA and Walker-Finch K and Willett J and Ucer C and Speechley SD','British dental journal',NULL,'Dental Care,Dental Implantation, Endosseous,*Dental Implants,*Dental Occlusion,*Dental Prosthesis, Implant-Supported,Dental Restoration Failure,Humans'),(198,2,'30663575','30663575','Hepatitis C Virus: Efficacy of New DAAs Regimens.','BACKGROUND: HCV treatment showed dramatical change due to the introduction of potent, strong, direct antiviral drugs. Before the appearance of Direct-acting antivirals, multiple therapeutic interventions were used for hepatitis C, but none of these interventions were effective on patient-centered outcomes. Direct-acting antivirals cause disruption of viral replication because they target specific nonstructural viral proteins. AIM: To review the advantages of efficient HCV therapy and its long term drawbacks. METHODS: A search of the literature published in indexed databases (PubMed, Medline In-Process, and Embase) within the last 5 years was conducted. Any duplicated citations were excluded before first-pass screening. Citations (titles and abstracts) were screened for eligibility by a single reviewer. Full texts (including congress abstracts, posters and other congress communications) of citations deemed relevant during title and abstract screening were retrieved for second-pass review. RESULTS: Studies on the clinical effects of DAAs for hepatitis C show better tolerance, improved survival and fewer complications when compared to previous interferon therapy. CONCLUSION: HCV treatment has improved dramatically. Since that time, there are multiple approved oral therapies all with high efficacy.

METHODS: Electronic databases and grey literature sources were searched. Eligibility criteria initially included comparative studies on Ebola and Marburg virus diseases reported in English or French, but criteria were expanded to studies on other viral hemorrhagic fevers and non-comparative designs due to the paucity of studies.

The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework was used to inform the quality of evidence assessments. RESULTS: Thirty non-comparative studies (8 related to Ebola virus disease) were located, and 27 provided data on viral transmission.

This study aimed to determine how usability and safety guidelines of CIS consider clinical workflow through a systematic review in terms of the target systems, methodology, and guideline components of relevant articles. Methods: A literature search was conducted for articles published from 2000 to 2015 in PubMed, Cochrane, EMBASE, Web of Science, and CINAHL. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement method was employed. Articles containing recommendations, principles, and evaluation items for CIS usability and safety were included. The selected articles were classified according to article type, methodology, and target systems. Taking clinical workflow into consideration, the components of guidelines were extracted and classified. Results: A total of 7,401 articles were identified by keyword search. From the 76 articles remaining after abstract screening, 15 were selected through full-text review. Literature review (n = 7) was the most common methodology, followed by expert opinions (n = 6). Computerized physician order entry (n = 6) was the most frequent system. Four articles considered the entire process of clinical tasks, and two articles considered the principles of the entire process of user interface affecting clinical workflow. Only two articles performed heuristic evaluations of CISs.

METHODS: The aim of this qualitative systematic review was to search the academic and grey literature to identify and assess tools or interventions used in dental care settings to maintain or improve patient safety. All study designs were included from all dental care settings. Outcome measures were: patient safety, harm prevention, risk minimization, patient satisfaction and patient acceptability, professional acceptability, efficacy, cost-effectiveness and efficiency. Quality assessments were performed on the included studies based on CASP tools. Further analysis was undertaken to discover whether any of the tools had been trialled or verified by the authors, or by subsequent authors. RESULTS: Following abstract screening, and initial qualitative synthesis, nine studies were found to meet the inclusion criteria with 31 being excluded following initial analysis. Tools identified included: checklists (4 studies), reporting systems (3), the use of electronic notes (1) and trigger tools (1). Grey literature searching did not identify any further appropriate studies. In terms of study design, there were observational studies including audit cycles (5 studies), epidemiological studies (3) and prospective cluster randomised clinical trials (1). The quality of the studies varied and none of their outcomes were verified by other researchers. The tools identified have the potential to be used for measuring and improving patient safety in dentistry, with two surgical safety checklists demonstrating a reduction in erroneous dental extractions to nil following their introduction. Reporting systems provide epidemiological data, however, it is not known whether they lead to any improvement in patient safety. The one study on trigger tools demonstrates a 50 % positive predictive value for safety incidents. It is not clear as to what impact the introduction of electronic guidelines has on patient safety outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review finds that the only interventions in dentistry that reduce or minimise adverse events are surgical safety checklists. We believe this to be the first systematic review in this field; it demonstrates the need for further research into patient safety in dentistry across several domains: epidemiological, conceptual understanding and patient and practitioner involvement.','Bailey E and Tickle M and Campbell S and O\'Malley L','BMC oral health',NULL,'Cost-Benefit Analysis,*Dentistry,Humans,Outcome Assessment, Health Care,*Patient Safety,Prospective Studies,Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic'),(206,2,'24154518','24154518','Use of autologous fat grafting for reconstruction postmastectomy and breast conserving surgery: a systematic review protocol.','INTRODUCTION: There is growing interest in the potential use of autologous fat grafting (AFG) for the purposes of breast reconstruction.

A lack of complete and transparent reporting of the investigated trial outcomes limits reproducibility of results and knowledge synthesis efforts, and contributes to outcome switching and other reporting biases. Outcome-specific extensions for the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT-Outcomes) and Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT-Outcomes) reporting guidelines are under development to facilitate harmonized reporting of outcomes in trial protocols and reports. The aim of this review was to identify and synthesize existing guidance for trial outcome reporting to inform extension development. METHODS: We searched for documents published in the last 10 years that provided guidance on trial outcome reporting using: an electronic bibliographic database search (MEDLINE and the Cochrane Methodology Register); a grey literature search; and solicitation of colleagues using a snowballing approach. Two reviewers completed title and abstract screening, full-text screening, and data charting after training. Extracted trial outcome reporting guidance was compared with candidate reporting items to support, refute, or refine the items and to assess the need for the development of additional items. RESULTS: In total, 1758 trial outcome reporting recommendations were identified within 244 eligible documents. The majority of documents were published by academic journals (72%). Comparison of each recommendation with the initial list of 70 candidate items led to the development of an additional 62 items, producing 132 candidate items. The items encompassed outcome selection, definition, measurement, analysis, interpretation, and reporting of modifications between trial documents. The total number of documents supporting each candidate item ranged widely (median 5, range 0-84 documents per item), illustrating heterogeneity in the recommendations currently available for outcome reporting across a large and diverse sample of sources. CONCLUSIONS: Outcome reporting guidance for clinical trial protocols and reports lacks consistency and is spread across a large number of sources that may be challenging to access and implement in practice. Evidence and consensus-based guidance, currently in development (SPIRIT-Outcomes and CONSORT-Outcomes), may help authors adequately describe trial outcomes in protocols and reports transparently and completely to help reduce avoidable research waste.','Butcher NJ and Mew EJ and Monsour A and Chan AW and Moher D and Offringa M','Trials',NULL,''),(208,2,'21534234','21534234','Pregnancy in chronic kidney disease: need for a common language.','INTRODUCTION: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a growing health care problem, affecting 3% of women of childbearing age. AIM: This study attempted to systematically review the literature for 2000-2009 on pregnancy in CKD, as a guide for counseling. METHODS: Data sources included a Medline search for 2000-2009, employing MESH and free terms on pregnancy and CKD, limited to humans and English-language publications. Only studies observing at least 25 pregnancies were considered. The bibliographic search, abstract screening and data extraction were performed in duplicate. Out of over 3,000 references and 276 full texts, 23 studies fulfilled the selection criteria; 3 were added from references. RESULTS: The 26 studies reported on over 2,000 pregnancies. Five main categories were identified: CKD (399 pregnancies, excluding 2 population studies), lupus nephropathy (431 pregnancies), diabetic nephropathy (386 pregnancies), hematuria (310 pregnancies), kidney donors (586 pregnancies) and other. Definitions of diseases, outcomes and stratifications were nonhomogeneous, thus impairing meta-analytic pooling and quantification of the risks. Within these limits, 3 major qualitative determinants of outcome were confirmed as relevant in all subsets: CKD stage, hypertension and proteinuria. Their combination may multiply the interrelated major risks (for the mother: preeclampsia, renal function impairment and proteinuria; for the offspring: small babies, prematurity, death). Specifically, mothers with lupus nephritis have a relevant risk of death (1.15%), and share with diabetic nephropathy, the risk for perinatal death (up to 23% in lupus, 10% in diabetes). Malformations were not increased, except for urinary tract malformation in reflux nephropathy.

This has highlighted the large discrepancy between the capacity to treat and the ability to afford treatment, and the effect of this problem on access to care. This review focuses on the sources and challenges of funding paediatric surgical procedures in sub-Saharan Africa. Methods: We undertook a search for studies published between January 2007 and November 2016 that reported the specific funding of paediatric surgical procedures and were conducted in sub-Saharan Africa. Abstract screening, full-text review and data abstraction were completed and resulting data were analysed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) software. Results: Thirty-five studies met our inclusion criteria and were reviewed. The countries that were predominantly emphasized in the publications reviewed were Nigeria, South Africa, Kenya, Ghana and Uganda. The paediatric surgical procedures involved general paediatric surgery/urology, cardiac surgery, neurosurgery, oncology, plastics, ophthalmology, orthopaedics and otorhinolaryngology. The mean cost of these procedures ranged from 60 to 21,140 United States Dollars (USD). The source of funding for these procedures was mostly out-of-pocket payments (OOPs) by the patient\'s family in 32 studies, (91.4%) and medical mission/non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in 21 (60%) studies. This pattern did not differ appreciably between the articles published in the initial and latter 5 years of the study period, although there was a trend towards a reduction in OOP funding. Improvements in healthcare funding by individual countries supported by international organizations and charities were the predominant suggested solutions to challenges in funding. Conclusion: While considering the potential limitations created by diversity in study design, the reviewed publications indicate that funding for paediatric surgical procedures in sub-Saharan Africa is mostly by OOPs made by families of the patients. This may result in limited access to some procedures. Coordinated efforts, and collaboration between individual countries and international agencies, may help to reduce OOP funding and thus improve access to critical procedures.','Ekenze SO and Jac-Okereke CA and Nwankwo EP','Malawi medical journal : the journal of Medical Association of Malawi',NULL,'Africa South of the Sahara,*Health Expenditures,*Healthcare Financing,Humans,*Pediatrics,Surgical Procedures, Operative/*economics'),(210,2,'28586942','28586942','[Drawing up a Guideline for Handling Information and Communication Technology, Flexibility and Availability in Small and Medium Enterprises].','BACKGROUND: Within the last decades the world of work has changed enormously. Due to new Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), working at any time from any place has become possible. Flexibility, availability and the dissolution of boundaries between work and private life are the possible results of this development. The spread of this development and possible consequences on the affected employee\'s health and wellbeing have been examined so far especially in big companies. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) are rarely subjects of scientific studies in this context. OBJECTIVE OF THIS PAPER: The aim of this work was to develop a guideline based on experiences and results of a study regarding flexibility in the business world (FlexA), as well as a systematic literature research. The target populations of this guideline are SMEs, focusing on integrating a health promoting way in dealing with ICT, flexibility and availability within the corporate culture. METHODS: In order to delineate the current state in of research in ICT-related work interventions, a systematic review in data bases e. g. PsycINFO, EconLit and Medline was carried out. The search strategy used the key words \"work\", \"intervention\", \"ICT\", \"mental strain\", \"flexibility\" and \"availability\". In addition, grey literature and findings from the FlexA study were used to formulate the current guideline. RESULTS: Based on the exclusion criteria, all studies from the systematic literature search were excluded after title and abstract screening. Within grey literature research, 4 relevant publications could be identified. The measures, developed during the corporate workshops of the FlexA study, e. g. the implementation of collective regulations in the company, were included in the guideline. CONCLUSION: Due to the ongoing development of ICT and flexibility in daily business life, it is getting more and more important to follow this progress. Executives and corporate management are responsible to actively shape this trend in a health-promoting way in their enterprises. The current guideline was made to support the corporate management in this task and it is an important instrument for a health-promoting use of ICT in daily business life taking in to consideration flexibility and availability.','Weilnhammer V and Heinze S and Heiden B and Palm E and Herbig B and Luke G and Nowak D and Glaser J and Herr CEW','Gesundheitswesen (Bundesverband der Arzte des Offentlichen Gesundheitsdienstes (Germany))',NULL,'Commerce,*Communication,Employment,Germany,*Occupational Health'),(211,2,'32178987','32178987','A clinical guideline for structured assessment of CT-imaging in congenital lung abnormalities.','OBJECTIVES: To develop a clinical guideline for structured assessment and uniform reporting of congenital lung abnormalities (CLA) on Computed Tomography (CT)-scans. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted for articles describing CT-scan abnormalities of congenital pulmonary airway malformation (CPAM), bronchopulmonary sequestration (BPS), congenital lobar emphysema (CLE) and bronchogenic cyst (BC). A structured report using objective features of CLA was developed after consensus between a pediatric pulmonologist, radiologist and surgeon. RESULTS: Of 1581 articles identified, 158 remained after title-abstract screening by two independent reviewers. After assessing full-texts, we included 28 retrospective cohort-studies. Air-containing cysts and soft tissue masses are described in both CPAM and BPS while anomalous arterial blood supply is only found in BPS. Perilesional low-attenuation areas, atelectasis and mediastinal shift may be found in all aforementioned abnormalities and can also be seen in CLE as a cause of a hyperinflated lobe. We have developed a structured report, subdivided into five sections: Location & Extent, Airway, Lesion, Vascularization and Surrounding tissue. CONCLUSIONS: CT-imaging findings in CLA are broad and nomenclature is variable. Overlap is seen between and within abnormalities, possibly due to definitions often being based on pathological findings, which is an unsuitable approach for CT imaging.

The purpose of this study is to access whether patients who participated in preoperative rehabilitation before primary TKA received any postoperative benefit compared to patients who did not participate in preoperative rehabilitation. Materials and Methods: A comprehensive search of Medline, PubMed, Embase, CENTRAL, CINAHL, Ageline, and hand searching references and abstracts was performed. Inclusion criteria included patients undergoing primary and unilateral TKA. Exclusion criteria included patients who have bilateral, unicompartmental, or revision TKA. All studies compared preoperative exercise program versus no preoperative exercise. Outcomes included patients\' function, acute care length of stay (LOS), pain, and stiffness. The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index and 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey functional scales were used to assess these outcomes. Assessment was performed within 3 months of TKA. Results: Of 1347 articles, 1308 studies were excluded during title and abstract screening. Thirty nine articles underwent full-text screening and were narrowed to five studies matching all criteria. Two studies were combined showing a significant decrease in LOS favoring preoperative exercise (-0.93, 95% confidence interval: -1.29, -0.57). There was a lack of evidence to show any difference regarding self-reported function, stiffness, pain, and physical role. Conclusion: Preoperative exercise program may be beneficial and is associated with a significant decrease in length of hospital stay. No conclusive evidence can be delineated from the literature with respect to clinical outcome measures. Well-designed randomized trials would strengthen this position.','Sharma R and Ardebili MA and Abdulla IN','Indian journal of orthopaedics',NULL,''),(213,2,'22081544','22081544','Building student proficiency with scientific literature using the Zotero reference manager platform.','While mastery of the scientific literature is a strongly desirable trait for undergraduate students, the sheer volume of the current literature has complicated the challenge of teaching scientific literacy.

METHODS: The definition of a PHR published in ISO 14292 was used to scope this review and the search strategy. Publications were included if the introduction of a PHR was the primary intervention, and if its evaluation met one of the Cochrane EPOC Group criteria. Studies were excluded if they only reported the design or basic user acceptance of a PHR system without an assessment of its impact on individuals and/or their health care. The impacts were classified according to the six aims of 21st-century health care defined by the US Institute of Medicine. RESULTS: Searches were conducted in PubMed in December 2012. Out of 741 papers that met our initial search criteria, 31 were retained after title and abstract screening. After full paper review 5 studies were found to report original evidence of impact. Of these, three reported beneficial impacts on effectiveness, one on patient centredness, and one study reported impact on both aims. No harmful effects were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Although this literature review did identify some evidenced benefits from the use of PHRs and systems, our main observation is that there are very few studies published that seek to formally evaluate impact. The majority of publications we screened documented designs or basic user acceptance. Further investment in evaluation is needed to inform the evolution of this field.','Kalra D and Fernando B','Yearbook of medical informatics',NULL,'*Electronic Health Records,*Health Records, Personal,Humans'),(215,2,'28892119','28892119','Prophylactic chemotherapy for hydatidiform mole to prevent gestational trophoblastic neoplasia.','BACKGROUND: This is an update of the original Cochrane Review published in Cochrane Library, Issue 10, 2012.Hydatidiform mole (HM), also called a molar pregnancy, is characterised by an overgrowth of foetal chorionic tissue within the uterus. HMs may be partial (PM) or complete (CM) depending on their gross appearance, histopathology and karyotype. PMs usually have a triploid karyotype, derived from maternal and paternal origins, whereas CMs are diploid and have paternal origins only. Most women with HM can be cured by evacuation of retained products of conception (ERPC) and their fertility preserved. However, in some women the growth persists and develops into gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN), a malignant form of the disease that requires treatment with chemotherapy. CMs have a higher rate of malignant transformation than PMs. It may be possible to reduce the risk of GTN in women with HM by administering prophylactic chemotherapy (P-Chem). However, P-Chem given before or after evacuation of HM to prevent malignant sequelae remains controversial, as the risks and benefits of this practice are unclear. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of P-Chem to prevent GTN in women with a molar pregnancy. To investigate whether any subgroup of women with HM may benefit more from P-Chem than others. SEARCH METHODS: For the original review we performed electronic searches in the Cochrane Gynaecological Cancer Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, Issue 2, 2012), MEDLINE (1946 to February week 4, 2012) and Embase (1980 to 2012, week 9). We developed the search strategy using free text and MeSH. For this update we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, Issue 5, 2017), MEDLINE (February 2012 to June week 1, 2017) and Embase (February 2012 to 2017, week 23). We also handsearched reference lists of relevant literature to identify additional studies and searched trial registries. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of P-Chem for HM. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion in the review and extracted data using a specifically designed data collection form. Meta-analyses were performed by pooling data from individual trials using Review Manager 5 (RevMan 5) software in line with standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane methodology. MAIN RESULTS: The searches identified 161 records; after de-duplication and title and abstract screening 90 full-text articles were retrieved. From these we included three RCTs with a combined total of 613 participants. One study compared prophylactic dactinomycin to no prophylaxis (60 participants); the other two studies compared prophylactic methotrexate to no prophylaxis (420 and 133 participants). All participants were diagnosed with CMs. We considered the latter two studies to be of poor methodological quality.P-Chem reduced the risk of GTN occurring in women following a CM (3 studies, 550 participants; risk ratio (RR) 0.37, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.24 to 0.57; I(2) = 0%; P < 0.00001; low-quality evidence). However, owing to the poor quality (high risk of bias) of two of the included studies, we performed sensitivity analyses excluding these two studies. This left only one small study of high-risk women to contribute data for this primary outcome (59 participants; RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.73; P = 0.01); therefore we consider this evidence to be of low quality.The time to diagnosis was longer in the P-Chem group than the control group (2 studies, 33 participants; mean difference (MD) 28.72, 95% CI 13.19 to 44.24; P = 0.0003; low-quality evidence); and the P-Chem group required more courses to cure subsequent GTN (1 poor-quality study, 14 participants; MD 1.10, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.68; P = 0.0002; very low quality evidence).There were insufficient data to perform meta-analyses for toxicity, overall survival, drug resistance and reproductive outcomes. AUTHORS\' CONCLUSIONS: P-Chem may reduce the risk of progression to GTN in women with CMs who are at a high risk of malignant transformation; however, current evidence in favour of P-Chem is limited by the poor methodological quality and small size of the included studies. As P-Chem may increase drug resistance, delays treatment of GTN and may expose women toxic side effects, this practice cannot currently be recommended.','Wang Q and Fu J and Hu L and Fang F and Xie L and Chen H and He F and Wu T and Lawrie TA','The Cochrane database of systematic reviews',NULL,'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use,Dactinomycin/*therapeutic use,Female,Gestational Trophoblastic Disease/epidemiology/*prevention & control,Humans,Hydatidiform Mole/*drug therapy,Incidence,Methotrexate/*therapeutic use,Pregnancy,Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic'),(216,2,'30055659','30055659','Single screen of citations with excluded terms: an approach to citation screening in systematic reviews.','Citation screening during the systematic review process can be time-consuming due to the exponentially increasing amount of research.

Research related to adherence from the perspectives of adults with CF has been recommended for a further understanding of adherence. This review synthesized the qualitative evidence on adherence of adults with CF to medication regimens and should be of interest to healthcare providers. REVIEW QUESTION: The question addressed in this review is, what are the experiences and perceptions of adults with CF and their adherence to a medication regimen? TYPES OF PARTICIPANTS: Adults with CF who are maintaining a medication regimen. PHENOMENON OF INTEREST: The phenomenon of interest of this review is the experiences and perceptions of CF-affected adults who are taking prescribed medications to treat their CF and related conditions. TYPES OF STUDIES: This review included qualitative studies with the following designs: naturalistic inquiry, grounded theory, phenomenology and interpretive description. The gray literature was searched; however, no items were retained for the review. SEARCH STRATEGY: The search strategy used a three-step approach and was aimed at locating both published and unpublished studies. Key databases included, but were not limited to, CINAHL, PubMed and PsycINFO. The searches were not limited by date or language because we wanted to capture all existing qualitative studies related to the experiences and perceptions of adults following medication regimens. During the title and abstract screening, only English and French articles were included. METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY: Qualitative studies triaged for appraisal were assessed by two Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI)-certified reviewers for methodological quality before inclusion. The reviewers used the JBI critical appraisal instruments, specifically the JBI Qualitative Assessment and Review Instrument (JBI-QARI). DATA EXTRACTION: Data were independently extracted from the studies included in the review by two reviewers using the standardized data extraction tool from JBI-QARI. DATA SYNTHESIS: Data were synthesized using the JBI process of meta-aggregation, identification of categories and development of a synthesized finding using the JBI-QARI software and methods. RESULTS: Eight studies were included in the review. Twenty-two findings were aggregated into four categories culminating in one synthesized finding. The synthesis revealed that adults with CF carry both a physical and a psychosocial burden to adhere to medication regimens. CONCLUSION: Adults with CF carry a psychosocial burden to adhere to what healthcare providers expect, while trying to live a \"normal\" life. Consideration needs to be given to exploring with individuals what degree of adherence will assist them in maintaining health, yet be able to enjoy life.','Macdonald M and Martin-Misener R and Helwig M and Smith LJ and Godfrey CM and Curran J and Murphy A','JBI database of systematic reviews and implementation reports',NULL,'Adult,Cystic Fibrosis/*drug therapy,Health Personnel,Humans,*Medication Adherence,Qualitative Research'),(218,2,'23426708','23426708','The rhinological manifestations of women\'s health.','OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the literature and appraise the evidence reporting the effects of women\'s health, including pregnancy, postpartum, menstruation, oral contraception, menopause, and hormone replacement therapy, on common rhinological pathologies and nasal physiology.

The following databases were searched for original articles that evaluated our question: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, SPORTDiscus and PEDro databases. After title and abstract screening followed by full-text screening, the quality of included articles was assessed and their data was abstracted. Screening, data abstraction and quality assessment was performed and consensus was achieved by two reviewers. Range of motion (ROM) data were synthesized by meta-analyses for overall effect and subgroup analysis according to muscle group, method of heat application, single or multiple treatments, and reported tightness of muscle. Twelve studies were included and reported the effects of stretch with or without heat on ROM of 352 participants. Heat applications included ultrasound, shortwave diathermy and hot packs. Meta-analyses and subgroup analyses demonstrated greater increases in ROM after heat and stretch (H + S) than heat alone. Subgroup analysis of muscle groups and the method of heat application showed some trends, but no significant differences. Multiple treatments (more so than single treatments) showed consistent treatment effects of H + S versus stretch alone amongst subgroups.

Paravertebral blocks (PVBs) are a regional technique that has demonstrated efficacy in patients undergoing a variety of breast cancer-related surgeries. However, a specific understanding of PVB\'s efficacy in pain management in patients who undergo IBR is lacking. Methods: A systematic search of PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library electronic database was conducted to examine PVB administration in mastectomy patients undergoing IBR. Data were abstracted regarding: authors, publication year, study design, patient demographics, tumor laterality, tumor stage, type, and timing of reconstruction. The primary outcome was PVB efficacy, represented as patient-reported pain scores. Secondary outcomes of interest include narcotic consumption, postoperative nausea and vomiting, antiemetic use, and length of stay. Results: The search resulted in 1,516 unique articles. After title and abstract screening, 29 articles met the inclusion criteria for full-text review. Only 7 studies were included. Of those, 2 studies were randomized control trials and 5 were retrospective cohort studies. Heterogeneity of included studies precluded a meta-analysis. Overall, PVB patients had improved pain control, and less opioid consumption. Conclusion: PVBs are a regional anesthesia technique which may aid in pain management in the breast reconstructive setting. Evidence suggests that PVBs aid in controlling acute postoperative pain, reduce opioid consumption, and improve patient length of stay. However, some conflicting findings demonstrate a need for continued research in this area of pain control.','Tokita HK and Polanco TO and Shamsunder MG and Dabic S and Patel VG and Allen RJ Jr and Dayan JH and Mehrara BJ and Matros E and Nelson JA','Plastic and reconstructive surgery.

Honey bee stingers have a uniquely designed venom sac with a piston-containing bifurcated stinger that can remain in human skin and continue injecting venom after stinging.

We undertook a literature review to evaluate the evidence regarding the effectiveness and safety of methods of honey bee stinger removal. The initial search identified 23 articles of interest; following title and abstract screening, two studies met the inclusion criteria. The included articles used different methods and models to evaluate the relationship between venom injection over time, and one of these studies also compared different methods of stinger removal. The literature review was limited by the small number of studies on the topic, but both included studies include findings relevant to the clinical question of interest.

Existing reviews on the economic impact of ILI do not report information on drug consumption and its costs, nor do they provide data on the overall cost per episode. METHODS: The PRISMA-P checklist was used to design the research protocol. Studies included were cost of illness analysis (COI) and modeling studies that estimated the cost of ILI episodes. Records were searched from January 2000 to December 2016 in electronic bibliographic databases including Medline, Embase, Science Direct, the Cochrane Library, the Centre for Reviews and Disseminations of the University of York, and Google scholar. References from the included studies were hand-searched for completion. Abstract screening, full-text analysis and data extraction were performed by two reviewers independently and discrepancies were resolved by discussion with a third reviewer. A standardized, pre-piloted form was used for data extraction. All costs were converted to 2015 US$ Purchasing Power Parities. RESULTS: The literature search identified 5,104 records. After abstract and title screening, 76 studies were analyzed full-text and 27 studies were finally included in the review. Full estimates of the cost per episode range from US$19 in Korea to US$323 in Germany. Particularly, the cost per episode of laboratory confirmed influenza cases was estimated between US$64 and US$73. Inpatient and outpatient services account for the majority of the costs. Differences in the estimates may reflect country-specific characteristics, as well as other study-specific features including study design, identification strategy of ILI cases, study populations and types of costs included in the analysis.

In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of using two computer screens on the efficiency of conducting SRs. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: A cohort of reviewers before and after using dual monitors were compared with a control group that did not use dual monitors. The outcomes were time spent for abstract screening, full-text screening and data extraction, and inter-rater agreement. We adopted multivariate difference-in-differences linear regression models. RESULTS: A total of 60 SRs conducted by 54 reviewers were included in this analysis. We found a significant reduction of 23.81 minutes per article in data extraction in the intervention group relative to the control group (95% confidence interval: -46.03, -1.58, P = 0.04), which was a 36.85% reduction in time. There was no significant difference in time spent on abstract screening, full-text screening, or inter-rater agreement between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Using dual monitors when conducting SRs is associated with significant reduction of time spent on data extraction. No significant difference was observed on time spent on abstract screening or full-text screening. Using dual monitors is one strategy that may improve the efficiency of conducting SRs.','Wang Z and Asi N and Elraiyah TA and Abu Dabrh AM and Undavalli C and Glasziou P and Montori V and Murad MH','Journal of clinical epidemiology',NULL,'Computer Terminals/*statistics & numerical data,Data Mining/*statistics & numerical data,*Efficiency,Humans,Linear Models,*Review Literature as Topic,Time Factors'),(230,2,'31333975','31333975','Site-specific Patient-reported Outcome Measures for Hand Conditions: Systematic Review of Development and Psychometric Properties.','Background: There are a number of site-specific patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) for hand conditions used in clinical practice and research for assessing the efficacy of surgical and nonsurgical interventions. The most commonly used hand-relevant PROMs are as follows: Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH), QuickDASH (qDASH), Michigan Hand Questionnaire (MHQ), Patient Evaluation Measure (PEM), Upper Extremity Functional Index (UEFI), and Duruoz Hand Index (DHI). There has been no systematic evaluation of the published psychometric properties of these PROMs. Methods: A PRISMA-compliant systematic review of the development and validation studies of these hand PROMs was prospectively registered in PROSPERO and conducted to assess their psychometric properties. A search strategy was applied to Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, and CINAHL. Abstract screening was performed in duplicate. Assessment of psychometric properties was performed. Results: The search retrieved 943 articles, of which 54 articles met predefined inclusion criteria. There were 19 studies evaluating DASH, 8 studies evaluating qDASH, 13 studies evaluating MHQ, 5 studies evaluating UEFI, 4 studies evaluating PEM, and 5 studies evaluating DHI. Assessment of content validity, internal consistency, construct validity, reproducibility, responsiveness, floor/ceiling effect, and interpretability for each PROM is described. Conclusions: The psychometric properties of the most commonly used PROMs in hand research are not adequately described in the published literature. DASH, qDASH, and MHQ have the best-published psychometric properties, though they have either some poor psychometric performance or incompletely studied psychometric properties.

Degeneration of the auditory nerve, histologically assessed, correlates with electrophysiologically acquired measures, such as electrically evoked compound action potentials (eCAPs) in experimental animals. To predict degeneration of the auditory nerve in humans, where histology is impossible, this paper reviews the correlation between speech perception and eCAP recordings in cochlear implant patients. DATA SOURCES: PubMed and Embase. REVIEW METHODS: We performed a systematic search for articles containing the following major themes: cochlear implants, evoked potentials, and speech perception. Two investigators independently conducted title-abstract screening, full-text screening, and critical appraisal. Data were extracted from the remaining articles. RESULTS: Twenty-five of 1,429 identified articles described a correlation between speech perception and eCAP attributes. Due to study heterogeneity, a meta-analysis was not feasible, and studies were descriptively analyzed. Several studies investigating presence of the eCAP, recovery time constant, slope of the amplitude growth function, and spatial selectivity showed significant correlations with speech perception. In contrast, neural adaptation, eCAP threshold, and change with varying interphase gap did not significantly correlate with speech perception in any of the identified studies. CONCLUSIONS: Significant correlations between speech perception and parameters obtained through eCAP recordings have been documented in literature; however, reporting was ambiguous. There is insufficient evidence for eCAPs as a predictive factor for speech perception. More research is needed to further investigate this relation.

MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched to identify relevant studies published between January 2000 and May 2018. Articles underwent title and abstract screening followed by full-text screening. Study inclusion criteria are patients with suspected hip fracture, negative initial radiograph, MDCT as the index test, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or clinical follow-up as the reference standard, and DTA measure as the outcome. Demographic, methodologic, and study outcome data were extracted. Risk of bias was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS)-2 tool. DTA metrics were pooled using bivariate random-effects meta-analysis. From an initial 1385 studies, four studies reporting on 418 patients (174 with hip fractures) were included. Pooled summary statistics included the following: sensitivity (87%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 79-93), specificity (98%; 95% CI 95-99), and the area under the summary receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (0.972). MDCT has a high specificity for detecting hip fragility fractures, comparable to MRI, but a lower sensitivity. Local institutional factors may play a role in whether a patient receives MDCT or MRI, as imaging should not be delayed. If there is ongoing concern for fracture in a patient with a negative MDCT, MRI should be performed.

However, there is no consensus on the clinical implications of this relatively rare entity. Study Purpose: To systematically review and analyze all studies which have reported absence of LHBT. Methods: PubMed and EMBASE databases were searched. Also, a secondary search was performed by pearling the bibliography of all the full-text articles obtained. Pre defined inclusion criteria was used for abstract screening by two independent observers. Twenty three studies met our inclusion criteria, were included for the final analysis and the data was pooled. The cases were further sub-grouped according to the classification of Dierickx et al. Results: Till date, 35 cases of absent LHBT have been reported. Males and females were equally affected. Eight of these were bilateral and only four cases had other associated congenital anomalies. Majority of the patients presented with shoulder pain (85.7%) while 37.1% had shoulder instability (mainly anterior instability). The ABS type was the most common variant reported. The finding was missed in 60% of the cases on the initial MRI only to be detected later on shoulder arthroscopy. Conclusions: Congenitally absent LHBT may not be as rare as was previously thought to be. Due to the heterogeneity and the low level of evidence of the data available, it is hard to conclude if a congenitally absent LHBT is a cause of shoulder pain/impingement or instability on its own.

Despite the shift toward digital platforms enabled by electronic medical records, demonstrating a will to reform the health care sector, health systems face issues including security, interoperability, data fragmentation, timely access to patient data, and silos. The application of health care blockchains could enable data interoperability, enhancement of precision medicine, and reduction in prescription frauds through implementing novel methods in access and patient consent. OBJECTIVE: To summarize the evidence on the strategies and frameworks utilized to implement blockchains for patient data in health care to ensure privacy and improve interoperability and scalability. It is anticipated this review will assist in the development of recommendations that will assist key stakeholders in health care blockchain implementation, and we predict that the evidence generated will challenge the health care status quo, moving away from more traditional approaches and facilitating decision making of patients, health care providers, and researchers. METHODS: A systematic search of MEDLINE/PubMed, Embase, Scopus, ProQuest Technology Collection and Engineering Index will be conducted. Two experienced independent reviewers will conduct titles and abstract screening followed by full-text reading to determine study eligibility. Data will then be extracted onto data extraction forms before using the Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias Tool to appraise the quality of included randomized studies and the Risk of Bias in nonrandomized studies of Interventions to assess the quality of nonrandomized studies. Data will then be analyzed and synthesized. RESULTS: Database searches will be initiated in September 2018. We expect to complete the review in January 2019. CONCLUSIONS: This review will summarize the strategies and frameworks used to implement blockchains in health care to increase data privacy, interoperability, and scalability. This review will also help clarify if the strategies and frameworks required for the operationalization of blockchains in health care ensure the privacy of patient data while enabling efficiency, interoperability, and scalability.

In this setting, 5 distinct yet interlinked pathways are responsible for transmission. The complete transmission process is still not well understood. Designing and conducting a single research study capable of investigating all 5 complex and multifaceted pathways of hospital transmission would be costly and logistically burdensome. Therefore, this scoping review aims to synthesize the highest-quality published literature describing each of the 5 individual potential transmission pathways of MDROs in the healthcare setting and their overall contribution to patient-to-patient transmission. METHODS: In 3 databases, we performed 2 separate systematic searches for original research published during the last decade. The first search focused on MDRO transmission via the HCW or the environment to identify publications studying 5 specific transmission pathways: (1) patient to HCW, (2) patient to environment, (3) HCW to patient, (4) environment to patient, and (5) environment to HCW. The second search focused on overall patient-to-patient transmission regardless of the transmission pathway. Both searches were limited to transmission of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus, multidrug-resistant A. baumannii, and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae. After abstract screening of 5,026 manuscripts, researchers independently reviewed and rated the remaining papers using objective predefined criteria to identify the highest quality and most influential manuscripts. RESULTS: High-quality manuscripts were identified for all 5 routes of transmission. Findings from these studies were consistent for all pathways; however, results describing the routes from the environment/HCW to a noncolonized patient were more limited and variable. Additionally, most research focused on MRSA, instead of other MDROs. The second search yielded 10 manuscripts (8 cohort studies) that demonstrated the overall contribution of patient-to-patient transmission in hospitals regardless of the transmission route. For MRSA, the reported cross-transmission was as high as 40%. CONCLUSIONS: This scoping review brings together evidence supporting all 5 possible transmission pathways and illustrates the complex nature of patient-to-patient transmission of MDROs in hospitals. Our findings also confirm that transmission of MDROs in hospitals occurs frequently, suggesting that ongoing efforts are necessary to strengthen infection prevention and control to prevent the spread of MDROs.','Blanco N and O\'Hara LM and Harris AD','Infection control and hospital epidemiology',NULL,'Bacterial Infections/drug therapy/*transmission,Cross Infection/drug therapy/microbiology/*transmission,*Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial,Hospitals,Humans,Risk Factors'),(238,2,'31126762','31126762','A systematic review of nonoperative management in blunt thoracic aortic injury.','OBJECTIVE: The objective was to characterize the growing body of literature regarding nonoperative management of blunt thoracic aortic injury (BTAI). METHODS: A systematic search of MedLine, Embase, and Cochrane Central was completed to identify original articles reporting injury characteristics and outcomes in patients with BTAI managed nonoperatively during their index hospitalization. Article title and abstract screening, full-text review, and data abstraction were performed in duplicate, with discrepancies resolved by a third reviewer. The quality of each study was evaluated using the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Levels of Evidence. RESULTS: Of 2162 identified studies, 74 were included and reported on 8606 patients with BTAI who were managed nonoperatively between 1970 and 2016. Only one study was prospective. The median nonoperative sample size per study was 11 patients. The characterization of aortic injury grade differed across studies. Follow-up varied widely from 1 day to 118 months. Injury healing or improvement on follow-up imaging occurred in 34% (226 of 673 patients; reported in 37 studies), most often in the context of grade I intimal injury. Injury progression or requirement for a thoracic endovascular aneurysm repair for injury progression was 7.6% (66 of 873 patients; reported in 46 studies). A total of 37 studies reported aortic-related death, with an overall rate of 4.5% (37 of 827 patients) and a rate of 1% in grade I and II injuries (1 of 153 patients) and 18% in grade III and IV (9 of 50 patients). CONCLUSIONS: An increasing number of reports support nonoperative management of grade I intimal injury, consistent with Society for Vascular Surgery guidelines.

Over the past three decades there has been a move towards breast conservation and a focus on aesthetic outcomes while maintaining oncological safety. For some patients, mastectomy is the preferred option. There is growing interest in the potential use of nipple sparing mastectomy (NSM). However, oncological safety remains unproven, and the benefits and indications have not been clearly identified. The objective of this systematic review will be to determine the safety and efficacy of NSM as compared with skin sparing mastectomy (SSM). METHODS AND ANALYSIS: All original comparative studies including; randomised controlled trials, cohort studies and case-control studies involving women undergoing either NSM or SSM for breast cancer will be included. Outcomes are primary-relating to oncological outcomes and secondary-relating to clinical, aesthetic, patient reported and quality of life outcomes. A comprehensive electronic literature search, designed by a search specialist, will be undertaken. Grey literature searches will also be conducted. Eligibility assessment will occur in two stages; title and abstract screening and then full text assessment. Each step will be conducted by two trained teams acting independently. Data will then be extracted and stored in a database with standardised extraction fields to facilitate easy and consistent data entry. Data analysis will be undertaken to explore the relationship between NSM or SSM and preselected outcomes, heterogeneity will be assessed using the Cochrane tests. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This systematic review requires no ethical approval. It will be published in a peer-reviewed journal. It will also be presented at national and international conferences.

Several surgical interventions have been described to treat this condition. One of the most contested of these treatments is implant arthroplasty of the first MPJ. The primary aim of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the clinical benefit of first MPJ implant arthroplasty in regard to patient satisfaction. Reviewers formally trained in meta-analysis abstraction techniques searched databases and indices using medical subject heading terms and other methods to identify all relevant studies published since 1990. Initially, 3874 citations were identified and evaluated for relevance. Abstract screening produced 112 articles to be read in entirety, of which 47 articles studying 3049 procedures with a mean 61.48 (SD 45.03) month follow-up met all prospective inclusion criteria necessary for analysis. Overall crude patient satisfaction following first MPJ implant arthroplasty was 85.7% (95% confidence interval: 82.5%-88.3%). When adjusting for lower quality studies (retrospective, less than 5 years of follow-up, higher percent of patients lost to follow-up), the overall patient satisfaction increased to 94.5% (89.6%-97.2%) in the highest-quality studies. This adjustment also significantly decreased heterogeneity across studies (crude Q = 184.6, high-quality studies Q = 2.053). Additional a priori sources of heterogeneity were evaluated by subgroup analysis and meta-regression. In regards to patient satisfaction, this comprehensive analysis provides supportive evidence to the clinical benefit of first MPJ implant arthroplasties.

CNS tumours form the second most common group of cancers in children. Radiotherapy plays a major role in the treatment of many of these patients but also contributes to late side effects in long term survivors. Radiation dose inevitably deposited in healthy tissues outside the clinical target has been linked to detrimental late effects such as neurocognitive, behavioural and vascular effects in addition to endocrine abnormalities and second tumours. METHODS: A literature search was performed using keywords: protons, IMRT, CNS and paediatric. Of 189 papers retrieved, 10 were deemed relevant based on title and abstract screening. All papers directly compared outcomes from protons with photons, five papers included medulloblastoma, four papers each included craniopharyngioma and low grade gliomas and three papers included ependymoma. RESULTS: This review found that while proton beam therapy offered similar clinical target coverage, there was a demonstrable reduction in integral dose to normal structures.

However, in this analysis, different types of therapy (group vs individual, G-CBT and I-CBT, respectively), different providers (psychologist vs nonpsychologist), and different diagnosis (HD vs hoarding behaviour) were analysed together. Hence, it remains unclear if reported rate of changes was due to limits of the CBT model of HD or due to the fact that different applications of the model were analysed together. The aim of this meta-analysis is to highlight shortcomings in the description of existing approaches in G-CBT in HD and provide an up-to-date review of the current state of efficacy. We searched references for treatment trials of G-CBT for HD in adults with object hoarding, where treatment was conducted by a professional in PubMed, PsychINFO and Web of Science databases, and ResearchGate (for grey literature). Data on participants, treatment modalities, and outcomes were extracted; treatment effect-size was meta-analysed. Five hundred and forty-three references were found; after title and abstract screening, eight articles (178 participants) were retained of which seven were included in the meta-analysis. G-CBT showed improvement of HD severity at posttreatment (Hedge\'s g = 0.96). The rate of clinically reliable changes across groups of treatment was 21%-68% (M = 36.7%; SD = 12.1%). The meta-analyses showed a statistically but not clinically significant impact of age on effect-size. No publication bias was found. There is strong evidence supporting the efficacy of G-CBT including modified or extended versions of classical G-CBT protocols. However, controlled trials with follow-up assessment are needed to evaluate long-term G-CBT efficacy for HD.

The goal was to systematically review three key questions (KQs): (1) The effectiveness of screening for these conditions; (2) How adults with chronic GERD weigh the benefits and harms of screening, and what factors contribute to their preferences and decision to undergo screening; and (3) Treatment options for Barrett\'s esophagus (BE), dysplasia or stage 1 EAC (overview of reviews). METHODS: Bibliographic databases (e.g. Ovid MEDLINE(R)) were searched for each review in October 2018. We also searched for unpublished literature (e.g. relevant websites). The liberal accelerated approach was used for title and abstract screening. Two reviewers independently screened full-text articles. Data extraction and risk of bias assessments were completed by one reviewer and verified by another reviewer (KQ1 and 2). Quality assessments were completed by two reviewers independently in duplicate (KQ3). Disagreements were resolved through discussion. We used various risk of bias tools suitable for study design. The GRADE framework was used for rating the certainty of the evidence. RESULTS: Ten studies evaluated the effectiveness of screening. One retrospective study reported no difference in long-term survival (approximately 6 to 12 years) between those who had a prior esophagogastroduodenoscopy and those who had not (adjusted HR 0.93, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.58-1.50). Though there may be higher odds of a stage 1 diagnosis than a more advanced diagnosis (stage 2-4) if an EGD had been performed in the previous 5 years (OR 2.27, 95% CI 1.00-7.67). Seven studies compared different screening modalities, and showed little difference between modalities. Three studies reported on patients\' unwillingness to be screened (e.g. due to anxiety, fear of gagging). Eleven systematic reviews evaluated treatment modalities, providing some evidence of early treatment effect for some outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Little evidence exists on the effectiveness of screening and values and preferences to screening. Many treatment modalities have been evaluated, but studies are small. Overall, there is uncertainty in understanding the effectiveness of screening and early treatments.

Despite international guidelines recommending vaccination in patients with COPD, many patients remain unvaccinated. Reasons for vaccine non-acceptance are multifaceted and are likely to be influenced by multiple psychosocial factors and pre-existing health beliefs. The aim of this review was to identify interventions which have been shown to effectively increase vaccination rates in patients with COPD. Materials and Methods: A structured search of PubMed returned 491 titles. Following title and abstract screening, seven full-text articles reporting on 6 unique interventional studies were extracted for narrative synthesis. A variety of interventions were investigated which, for the purposes of this review, were grouped into patient-focussed, clinician-focussed and mixed interventions. Results: Three papers reported findings from clinical trials (2 unique studies) and 4 papers reported findings from before-after studies. Two studies were conducted in the primary care setting, the remaining studies were conducted in secondary and tertiary care. Most studies reported both influenza and pneumococcal vaccination rates. These studies suggest that multimodal interventions, which target multiple aspects of evidence-based care and use both patient-focussed and clinician-focussed techniques, may have the greatest impact on vaccination rates in patients with COPD. Conclusions: Further, adequately powered, high quality studies are needed. It is crucial for individual institutions to monitor their own vaccination rates to determine if there is scope for performance improvement.','Trethewey SP and Patel N and Turner AM','Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)',NULL,'Humans,Influenza Vaccines/*therapeutic use,Patient Acceptance of Health Care/psychology,Pneumococcal Vaccines/*therapeutic use,Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive/drug therapy/*prevention & control,Vaccination/*standards'),(245,2,'32655476','32655476','Recent Evidence Regarding the Association Between Migraine and Suicidal Behaviors: A Systematic Review.','Objective: The review presents a systematic analysis of literature investigating the association between migraine and suicidal behaviors.

Methods: The databases used in this systematic review included: Medline, PsycINFO, EMBASE (Ovid), Science Direct (Elsevier), Cochrane, and PubMed for all available years of publication from January 2015 onwards. The review included participants aged 16 and over who had been diagnosed with migraines with the following outcome variables: any suicidality, both fatal and non-fatal; suicidal ideation; and suicidal behavior. Results: The database searches yielded a total of 542 citations. Following title and abstract screening, 460 articles were excluded and a total of 21 citations were evaluated. After full-text review and excluding a further 11 non-eligible studies, a total of 10 studies were eligible for inclusion in the systematic review. Conclusions: Current existing research highlights the important association between the increased risk of suicidal behaviors in the clinical and general population among chronic migraineurs with/without aura worldwide. Future studies are needed to facilitate the development of clinical guidelines for risk assessment, targeted interventions, and evidence-based treatment of migraine to reduce the risk of suicide among this vulnerable population.','Karimi L and Hoppe D and Burdick C and Buultjens M and Wijeratne T and Crewther SG','Frontiers in neurology',NULL,''),(246,2,'29614524','29614524','International Normalized Ratio Targets for Left-Sided Mechanical Valve Replacement.','BACKGROUND: Guidelines recommend higher international normalized ratio (INR) targets for patients with mechanical valves believed to be at higher risk for thromboembolism. Higher INR targets are associated with increased bleeding risk. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis assessing effects of lower and higher INR targets on thromboembolic and bleeding risk in patients with mechanical heart valves. METHODS: We searched Cochrane CENTRAL, MEDLINE and EMBASE for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating lower versus higher INR targets for adults with bileaflet mechanical valves. We performed title and abstract screening, full-text review, risk of bias evaluation and data collection independently and in duplicate. We pooled data using a random effects model and used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework to evaluate overall quality of evidence. RESULTS: We identified six RCTs (n = 5,497). Lower INR targets were associated with significantly less bleeding-22% versus 40% (relative risk [RR]: 0.54, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.31, 0.93, p = 0.03, very low quality). There was no difference in thromboembolism-2% in both groups (RR: 1.28, 95% CI: 0.88, 1.85, p = 0.20, very low quality) or mortality-5.5% with lower INR targets versus 8.5% (RR: 1.00, 95% CI: 0.82, 1.21, p = 0.47, moderate quality). CONCLUSION: In patients with mechanical valves, higher INR targets are not supported by current evidence, which is of very low quality. In fact, our systematic review suggests that lower INR targets offer significantly lower bleeding risks with no significant difference in thromboembolic risk.','Gupta S and Belley-Cote EP and Sarkaria A and Pandey A and Spence J and McClure G and Panchal P and Jaffer IH and An K and Eikelboom J and Whitlock RP','Thrombosis and haemostasis',NULL,'Blood Coagulation/*drug effects,Drug Monitoring/*methods,Evidence-Based Medicine,Fibrinolytic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use,Heart Valve Prosthesis,Heart Valve Prosthesis Implantation/*adverse effects/instrumentation,Heart Valves/*surgery,Hemorrhage/chemically induced,Humans,*International Normalized Ratio,Predictive Value of Tests,Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic,Risk Assessment,Risk Factors,Thromboembolism/blood/diagnosis/etiology/*prevention & control,Treatment Outcome'),(247,2,'31789296','31789296','The effects of whole body vibration therapy on reducing fat mass in the adult general population: A systematic review and meta-analyses.','Whole Body Vibration (WBV) is a popular and a purported alternative to physical activity to reduce body fat, but reports of efficacy are inconsistent.

After title/abstract screening and full-text review, we identified 7 cohort studies and 6 case-control studies. Data extraction and quality assessment were performed independently, and a random-effects model was used for data synthesis. Subgroup analysis was conducted based on obesity, hormone replacement therapy use, and cancer subtype; sensitivity analysis was conducted by pooling risk ratios of the highest dosage or longest duration of use.

In overall meta-analysis, the pooled risk ratio was 0.93 (95% confidence interval, 0.88-0.99), and no substantial statistical heterogeneity was observed (I = 0.0%, P = 0.550). In subgroup analysis, a negative association was observed for obese women and type I endometrial cancer. Higher dosage or frequency of aspirin use was significantly associated with a reduced risk, and long-term aspirin use was protective only for obese women.

A certain degree of ambiguity remains, however, regarding the meaning of community engagement, which term has been used for various purposes and implemented in various forms. In this study, we aimed to explore the different definitions of community engagement, discuss the various objectives that have been proposed and uncover the diverse ways this concept has been implemented among researchers working for the betterment of the health and wellness of immigrant communities in host countries. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Taxonomy is a process for classifying complex and multifaceted matters using logical conceptual domains and dimensions for clearer way of contextualising. We will develop a taxonomy to organise the available literature on community engagement in immigrant health and wellness research in a way that captures user knowledge and understanding of its various meanings and processes. Specific methodological and analytical frameworks for systematic review and taxonomy development will guide each step. We will conduct a comprehensive systematic search in relevant databases, from inception to December 2019, using appropriate keywords followed by snowball search (single-citation tracking, reference lists). Papers will be included if they fall within predefined inclusion criteria (seen as most likely informative on elements pertaining to community engagement) and are written in English, regardless of design (conceptual, qualitative and quantitative). Two reviewers will independently employ two-stage screening (title-abstract screening followed by screening of the full text to determine inclusion). Finally, information that helps to develop taxonomy of the concept and practice of community engagement will be abstracted and used towards taxonomy development, where different levels of stakeholder research team members will be involved. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval is not required for this systematic review. We have opted for an integrated knowledge translation or a community-engaged knowledge mobilisation approach where we are engaged with community-based citizen researchers from the inception of our programme.

Articles reporting studies on educational health care simulation in developing countries were included. RESULTS: In total, 1161 publications were retrieved, of which 156 were considered eligible based on title and abstract screening. Thirty articles satisfied our predefined selection criteria. Most of the studies were case series; 76.7% (23/30) were prospective and comparative, and five were randomized trials. The development of dedicated task trainers and telesimulation were the primary techniques assessed. The retrieved studies showed encouraging trends in terms of trainee satisfaction with improvement after training, but the improvements were mainly tested on the training tool itself.

Evidence of their reliability and usability may improve their acceptance within the SR community. We explored the performance of three tools when used to: (a) eliminate irrelevant records (Automated Simulation) and (b) complement the work of a single reviewer (Semi-automated Simulation). We evaluated the usability of each tool. METHODS: We subjected three SRs to two retrospective screening simulations. In each tool (Abstrackr, DistillerSR, and RobotAnalyst), we screened a 200-record training set and downloaded the predicted relevance of the remaining records. We calculated the proportion missed and the workload and time savings compared to dual independent screening. To test usability, eight research staff undertook a screening exercise in each tool and completed a survey, including the System Usability Scale (SUS). RESULTS: Using Abstrackr, DistillerSR, and RobotAnalyst respectively, the median (range) proportion missed was 5 (0 to 28) percent, 97 (96 to 100) percent, and 70 (23 to 100) percent in the Automated Simulation and 1 (0 to 2) percent, 2 (0 to 7) percent, and 2 (0 to 4) percent in the Semi-automated Simulation. The median (range) workload savings was 90 (82 to 93) percent, 99 (98 to 99) percent, and 85 (85 to 88) percent for the Automated Simulation and 40 (32 to 43) percent, 49 (48 to 49 percent), and 35 (34 to 38 percent) for the Semi-automated Simulation. The median (range) time savings was 154 (91 to 183), 185 (95 to 201), and 157 (86 to 172) hours for the Automated Simulation and 61 (42 to 82), 92 (46 to 100), and 64 (37 to 71) hours for the Semi-automated Simulation. Abstrackr identified 33-90% of records erroneously excluded by a single reviewer, while RobotAnalyst performed less well and DistillerSR provided no relative advantage. Based on reported SUS scores, Abstrackr fell in the usable, DistillerSR the marginal, and RobotAnalyst the unacceptable usability range. Usability depended on six interdependent properties: user friendliness, qualities of the user interface, features and functions, trustworthiness, ease and speed of obtaining predictions, and practicality of the export file(s). CONCLUSIONS: The workload and time savings afforded in the Automated Simulation came with increased risk of erroneously excluding relevant records. Supplementing a single reviewer\'s decisions with relevance predictions (Semi-automated Simulation) improved upon the proportion missed in some cases, but performance varied by tool and SR.

Since 2004, the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF) has published 16 guidelines. The objective of this review was to evaluate clinicians\' adherence to these guidelines\' recommendations as measured in the literature. DATA SOURCES: We searched PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science on August 29, 2019, for studies published after June 1, 2004. REVIEW METHODS: We systematically identified peer-reviewed studies in English that reported clinician adherence to AAO-HNSF guideline recommendations. Two authors independently reviewed and abstracted study characteristics, including publication date, population, sample size, guideline adherence, and risk of bias. RESULTS: The search yielded 385 studies. We excluded 331 studies during title/abstract screening and 32 more after full-text review. The remaining 22 studies evaluated recommendations from 8 of the 16 guidelines. The Otitis Media with Effusion, Polysomnography, Tonsillectomy, and Sinusitis guidelines were studied most. Study designs included retrospective chart reviews (7, 32%), clinician surveys (7, 32%), and health care database analyses (8, 36%). Studies reported adherence ranging from 0% to 99.8% with a mean of 56%. Adherence varied depending on the recommendation evaluated, type of recommendation, clinician type, and clinical setting. Adherence to the polysomnography recommendations was low (8%-65.3%). Adherence was higher for the otitis media with effusion (76%-90%) and tonsillectomy (43%-98.9%) recommendations.

METHODS: By following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses guidelines, 9 databases were systematically searched. Seven studies met the inclusion criteria after title and/or abstract screening and full-text assessment. These were appraised by using the Relevance, Appropriateness, Transparency, Soundness checklist. Thematic analysis guided data extraction and identification of the findings. The Confidence in the Evidence for Reviews of Qualitative Research tool was applied to assess the confidence of the findings. RESULTS: The review showed high confidence in 4 findings: an increase in quality of life, feeling forced to accept home mechanical ventilation, collaboration between home-care assistants and users of home mechanical ventilation is challenging, and information about the technology from a user\'s perspective. The review showed moderate confidence in 2 findings: living at home is pivotal for a normalized everyday life, and home mechanical ventilation causes a life with continued worries and uncertainty. CONCLUSIONS: According to the users, treatment by home mechanical ventilation resulted in increased well-being and facilitated a community- and home-based lifestyle compared with institutional-based treatment. However, the users also expressed difficulties in coming to terms with the necessary extensive surveillance, which gave rise to a sense of undermined autonomy and self-determinism as well as continued worries and uncertainty.

However, evidence on effects of patient-centred interventions is still limited and mixed. In part, the lack of consistent evidence has its roots in a conceptual uncertainty of the term \'PC\', which also hampers the development of assessment tools for PC. Consequently, reviews on assessment instruments of PC reveal problems regarding the quality of identified assessment instruments and regarding their comparability. Some of these reviews focus on the elderly. However, while the concept of multimorbidity is partly inherent, this focus is not explicit in any of the reviews.The aim of this systematic review is to identify assessment instruments of PC in the multimorbid elderly, using a subgroup-specific definition of PC (\'subgroup-specific integrative model of PC\') as the conceptual underpinning, and to provide a critical quality appraisal of their psychometric properties. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A comprehensive systematic literature search for assessment tools on PC will be conducted in the MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Web of Science and PSYNDEX electronic databases. The search strategy will be informed by the subgroup-specific integrative model of PC. The electronic literature search will be complemented by a hand-search combining citation tracking, search in project databases, and contacting authors from relevant studies/reviews. The literature search (systematic and hand-search) will cover the period from November, 2018 to December 2019.The retrieval of relevant studies will be conducted via title screening, abstract screening, and full-text eligibility assessment applying defined inclusion criteria.

Exposure to IPV is associated with poor health outcomes and the prevalence of violence may be higher amongst women seeking healthcare. Existing evidence from the Arab region is limited. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of prevalence and health outcomes of domestic violence (IPV or violence from a family member) in clinical populations in Arab countries. METHODS: Using terms related to domestic violence, Arab countries, and date limit > year 2000, we searched seven databases: Medline, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Web of Science: core collection, IBSS, Westlaw, IMEMR. We included observational studies reporting estimates of prevalence or health outcomes of domestic violence amongst women aged > 15 years, recruited while accessing healthcare in Arab countries. Studies that collected data on/after 1st January 2000 and were published in English, Arabic or French were included. Title/abstract screening, full text screening, quality assessment and data extraction were carried out. Extracted data were summarised and meta-analysis was performed where appropriate. RESULTS: 6341 papers were screened and 41 papers (29 studies) met inclusion criteria. Total 19,101 participants from 10 countries were represented in the data. Meta-analysis produced pooled prevalence estimates of lifetime exposure to any type of IPV of 73.3% (95% CI 64.1-81.6), physical IPV 35.6% (95% CI 24.4-47.5), sexual IPV 22% (95% CI 13.3-32) and emotional/psychological IPV 49.8% (95% CI 37.3-62.3). Domestic violence (IPV or family violence) exposure was associated with increased odds of adverse health outcomes: depression OR 3.3 (95% CI 1.7-6.4), sleep problems OR 3.2 (95% CI 1.5-6.8), abortion OR 3.5 (95% CI 1.2-10.2), pain OR 2.6 (95% CI 1.6-4.1) and hypertension OR 1.6 (95% CI 1.2-2.0).

Community-dwelling people with a SCI can prevent them with appropriate skin care (i.e. pressure relieving activities, skin checks). Adherence to skin care remains suboptimal however, and self-management interventions that focus on improving this have been designed. Little is known on their content, effectiveness, or theoretical basis. The aim of the proposed systematic review is to synthesize the literature on self-management interventions to improve skin care in people with a SCI. Specific objectives are to describe these interventions in relation to their content, effectiveness, theory base, and adherence to reporting guidelines for intervention description. METHODS: The search strategy will combine an electronic search of nine bibliographic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, PsycInfo, CENTRAL, CINAHL, Rehabdata, CIRRIE, PEDro, ERIC) and two trial registers with a manual search of relevant reference lists. Predefined eligibility criteria will be applied in a two-phase selection process involving title and abstract screening, followed by full-text screening. A data extraction spreadsheet will be applied to included papers. Intervention content will be coded using two taxonomies (behaviour change taxonomy; PRISMS self-management support taxonomy). A validated tool (Theory Coding Scheme) and the Template for Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR) will be used to examine theoretical basis and assess adherence to reporting guidelines for intervention description. A small number of heterogeneous studies are likely to be included in this review therefore a narrative synthesis is planned.

The instruments used to measure patient-related outcomes were then examined for their relevancy in justifying the results. Results: The initial search retrieved 2,143 papers of which 79 were shortlisted through title and abstract screening. A full-text reading indicated 38 papers met the inclusion and quality criteria. Summary data extracted from the articles on focus, design, sample size, and questionnaires/instruments used were presented in four themes: (a) QoL and wellbeing of PwP, (b) QoL and wellbeing of caregivers and family members, (c) employment and living conditions, and (d) direct and indirect health care and societal cost. Conclusion: UK results substantiated global evidence regarding the deterioration of QoL of PwP as the condition progressed, utilizing numerous measures to demonstrate change. Many spouses and family accept care responsibilities, affecting their QoL and finances too. The review highlighted increased health care and privately borne costs with condition progression, although UK evidence was limited on societal costs of Parkinson\'s in terms of loss of employment, reduced work hours, premature retirement of PwP and caregivers that directly affected their household budget.','Gumber A and Ramaswamy B and Thongchundee O','Patient related outcome measures',NULL,''),(262,2,'30645766','30645766','Cancer disparities in people with HIV: A systematic review of screening for non-AIDS-defining malignancies.','BACKGROUND: People with HIV (PWHIV) have improved survival because of the advent of antiretroviral therapy. Consequently, PWHIV experience higher rates of non-acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-defining malignancies (NADMs). Previous studies have demonstrated worsened cancer-specific survival in PWHIV, partly because of advanced cancer stage at diagnosis. The objective of the current systematic review was to evaluate screening disparities for NADMs among PWHIV. METHODS: The PubMed, Cochrane, EMBASE, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases were searched from January 1, 1996 through April 10, 2018 to identify studies related to screening disparities for NADMs among PWHIV. Eligibility criteria included any study performed in a high-income country that compared screening for NADMs by HIV status. After title/abstract screening and full-text review, articles that met eligibility criteria were analyzed. RESULTS: Of 613 unique articles identified through the search, 9 studies were analyzed. Three studies addressed breast cancer screening, 4 addressed colorectal cancer screening, and 2 addressed prostate cancer screening. Five of the reviewed studies demonstrated that PWHIV were less likely to receive indicated cancer screenings compared with the general population, whereas 3 indicated that screening proportions were higher among PWHIV, and 1 demonstrated that screening proportions were comparable. In most of the studies, PWHIV who had regular access to health care were more likely to undergo cancer screening. CONCLUSIONS: The available evidence does not uniformly confirm that PWHIV are less likely to receive cancer screening. Social determinants of health (insurance status, access to health care, education, income level) were associated with the receipt of appropriate cancer screening, suggesting that these barriers need to be addressed to improve cancer screening in PWHIV.','Corrigan KL and Wall KC and Bartlett JA and Suneja G','Cancer',NULL,'Breast Neoplasms/*diagnosis,Colorectal Neoplasms/*diagnosis,Early Detection of Cancer,Female,HIV Infections/*complications,Healthcare Disparities,Humans,Male,Prostatic Neoplasms/*diagnosis'),(263,2,'31446977','31446977','Effect of anti-inflammatory and analgesic drugs for the prevention of bleaching-induced tooth sensitivity: A systematic review and meta-analysis.','BACKGROUND: In-office dental bleaching results in a high risk of tooth sensitivity caused by the inflammatory process of the pulpal tissue. In this systematic review, the authors aimed to evaluate the effect of administering anti-inflammatory and analgesic drugs for the prevention of tooth sensitivity associated with in-office dental bleaching. TYPES OF STUDIES REVIEWED: The authors searched the databases MEDLINE via PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library for clinical trials. They searched in ClinicalTrials.gov for unpublished trials. The authors included only randomized clinical trials comparing anti-inflammatory and analgesic drugs with a placebo and evaluating tooth sensitivity after in-office bleaching.

They qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed the 11 studies remaining after the title and abstract screening. Nine studies showed a low risk of bias. The authors found no effect of the drugs on the risk (9 studies evaluated this outcome). Using a visual analog scale, the authors identified a similar level of sensitivity evaluated up to 1 hour (10 studies evaluated this outcome) and 24 hours (8 studies evaluated this outcome). They observed similar results using the numeric rate scale (8 and 6 studies used this tool, up to 1 hour and 24 hours respectively).

This study aimed to systematically search for studies reporting on the use of liquid biopsies (LB), the correlation between LBs and tissue biopsies, and finally the predictive value in the management of NSCLC. A systematic literature search was performed, including results published after 1 January 2014. Articles studying the predictive value or validity of a LB were included. The search (up to 1 September 2019) retrieved 1704 articles, 1323 articles were excluded after title and abstract screening. Remaining articles were assessed for eligibility by full-text review. After full-text review, 64 articles investigating the predictive value and 78 articles describing the validity were included. The majority of studies investigated the predictive value of LBs in relation to therapies targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) receptor (n = 38). Of studies describing the validity of a biomarker, 55 articles report on one or more EGFR mutations. Although a variety of blood-based biomarkers are currently under investigation, most studies evaluated the validity of LBs to determine EGFR mutation status and the subsequent targeting of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors based on the mutation status found in LBs of NSCLC patients.','van Delft F and Koffijberg H and Retel V and Heuvel MVD and IJzerman M','Cancers',NULL,''),(266,2,'23209672','23209672','Effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy for depression in patients receiving disability benefits: a systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis.','OBJECTIVES: To systematically summarize the randomized trial evidence regarding the relative effectiveness of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) in patients with depression in receipt of disability benefits in comparison to those not receiving disability benefits. DATA SOURCES: All relevant RCTs from a database of randomized controlled and comparative studies examining the effects of psychotherapy for adult depression (http://www.evidencebasedpsychotherapies.org), electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, PSYCINFO, AMED, CINAHL and CENTRAL) to June 2011, and bibliographies of all relevant articles. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, PARTICIPANTS AND INTERVENTION: Adult patients with major depression, randomly assigned to CBT versus minimal/no treatment or care-as-usual. STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS: Three teams of reviewers, independently and in duplicate, completed title and abstract screening, full text review and data extraction. We performed an individual patient data meta-analysis to summarize data. RESULTS: Of 92 eligible trials, 70 provided author contact information; of these 56 (80%) were successfully contacted to establish if they captured receipt of benefits as a baseline characteristic; 8 recorded benefit status, and 3 enrolled some patients in receipt of benefits, of which 2 provided individual patient data. Including both patients receiving and not receiving disability benefits, 2 trials (227 patients) suggested a possible reduction in depression with CBT, as measured by the Beck Depression Inventory, mean difference [MD] (95% confidence interval [CI]) = -2.61 (-5.28, 0.07), p = 0.06; minimally important difference of 5. The effect appeared larger, though not significantly, in those in receipt of benefits (34 patients) versus not receiving benefits (193 patients); MD (95% CI) = -4.46 (-12.21, 3.30), p = 0.26. CONCLUSIONS: Our data does not support the hypothesis that CBT has smaller effects in depressed patients receiving disability benefits versus other patients.

The purpose of this scoping review was to examine the empirical literature related to the health disparities and health needs of sexual minority women in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), and to identify research gaps and priorities. DESIGN: A scoping review methodology was used. DATA SOURCES: We conducted a comprehensive search of seven electronic databases. The search strategy combined keywords in three areas: sexual minority women, health, and LAC. English, Spanish, and Portuguese language studies published through 2017 in peer-reviewed journals were included. REVIEW METHODS: A total 1471 articles were retrieved. An additional 5 articles were identified following descendancy search; 3 of these met inclusion criteria. After removal of duplicates and title and abstract screening, we screened the full text of 37 articles, of which 22 (representing 18 distinct studies) met inclusion criteria. At least two authors independently reviewed and abstracted data from all articles. RESULTS: More than half of the studies were conducted in Brazil (n = 9) and Mexico (n = 5). Sexual health was the most studied health issue (n = 11). Sexual minority women were at elevated risk for sexually transmitted infections related to low use of barrier contraceptive methods during sexual encounters with men. Findings suggest that sexual minority women are generally distrustful of healthcare providers and view the healthcare system as heteronormative. Providers are believed to lack the knowledge and skills to provide culturally competent care to sexual minority women. Sexual minority women generally reported low levels of sexual health education and reluctance in seeking preventive screenings due to fear of mistreatment from healthcare providers. Sexual minority women also reported higher rates of poor mental health, disordered eating, and substance use (current tobacco and alcohol use) than heterosexual women. Gender-based violence was identified as a significant concern for sexual minority women in LAC. CONCLUSIONS: Significant knowledge gaps regarding sexual minority women\'s health in LAC were identified. Additional investigation of understudied areas where health disparities have been observed in other global regions is needed. Future research should explore how the unique social stressors sexual minority women experience impact their health. Nurses and other healthcare providers in the region need training in providing culturally appropriate care for this population.','Caceres BA and Jackman KB and Ferrer L and Cato KD and Hughes TL','International journal of nursing studies',NULL,'Caribbean Region,Female,Humans,Latin America,*Sexual and Gender Minorities,*Women\'s Health'),(268,2,'31051762','31051762','Conventional smears versus liquid-based preparations for thyroid fine-needle aspirates: a systematic review and meta-analysis.','INTRODUCTION: Thyroid fine-needle aspiration has traditionally been prepared using conventional smears (CS). Liquid-based preparations (LBP) have grown in popularity and yet, there is a lack of consensus about which method is superior. This review compared CS and LBP as an intervention in the management of thyroid nodules. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline, EMBASE, Scopus and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched to locate relevant studies. Observational studies comparing CS and LBP of consecutive thyroid fine-needle aspirations were included. Two reviewers independently screened, extracted, and entered data. Double data extraction included the following outcomes: (1) the proportion of inadequate smears and (2) the proportion of indeterminate smears. Studies were also assessed for risk of bias and heterogeneity. RESULTS: From 599 unique studies, title/abstract screening identified 136 studies, and full text screening identified 13 studies. The 13 studies included 24,307 fine-needle aspirations from 19,433 patients and had high clinical, methodological, and statistical heterogeneity with low risk of bias. For CS and LBP, a meta-analysis of 12 studies showed no difference in the proportion of inadequate smears (risk difference: -0.00; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.04-0.04); 13 studies showed no difference in the proportion of indeterminate smears (risk difference: -0.02; 95% CI: -0.05-0.01). Sensitivity analysis of studies with low risk of bias had similar results. CONCLUSIONS: There is no difference between CS and LBP in the proportion of inadequate and indeterminate smears. Recommendations of one method over the other should be based on cost, feasibility, and accuracy, all of which require further study.','Nagarajan N and Najafian A and Schneider EB and Zeiger MA and Olson MT','Journal of the American Society of Cytopathology',NULL,''),(269,2,'29904912','29904912','Duchenne muscular dystrophy and caregiver burden: a systematic review.','AIM: To conduct a systematic literature review of caregiver burden in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). METHOD: We searched Embase, Web of Science, and PubMed for full-text articles reporting results from studies of caregiver burden in DMD. RESULTS: We identified 483 unique publications. Of these, 450 were excluded after title and abstract screening, and 12 after full-text review. A total of 21 articles were included for data synthesis. Results encompassing more than 15 aspects of caregiver burden, investigated through surveys and/or interviews across 15 countries, were identified in the literature. Caregiving in DMD was frequently associated with impaired health-related quality of life, poor sleep quality, reduced family function, depression, pain, stress, sexual dysfunction, and/or lower self-esteem, as well as a considerable impact on work life and productivity. INTERPRETATION: Providing informal care to a patient with DMD can be associated with a substantial burden. Yet, more research is needed to better understand the clinical implications of caregiving in DMD and the relationship between caregiver burden and the progression of the disease. Our data synthesis should be helpful in informing clinical and social support programmes directed to families caring for a patient with DMD.

Extracting such relations from free text data is a challenging task because it lies on between medical natural language processing, temporal representation and temporal reasoning. OBJECTIVES: To survey existing methods for extracting temporal relations (TLINKs) between events from clinical free text in English; to establish the state-of-the-art in this field; and to identify outstanding methodological challenges. METHODS: A systematic search in PubMed and the DBLP computer science bibliography was conducted for studies published between January 2006 and December 2018. The relevant studies were identified by examining the titles and abstracts. Then, the full text of selected studies was analyzed in depth and information were collected on TLINK tasks, TLINK types, data sources, features selection, methods used, and reported performance. RESULTS: A total of 2834 publications were identified for title and abstract screening. Of these publications, 51 studies were selected. Thirty-two studies used machine learning approaches, 15 studies used a hybrid approaches, and only four studies used a rule-based approach. The majority of studies use publicly available corpora: THYME (28 studies) and the i2b2 corpus (17 studies). CONCLUSION: The performance of TLINK extraction methods ranges widely depending on relation types and events (e.g. from 32% to 87% F-score for identifying relations between clinical events and document creation time). A small set of TLINKs (before, after, overlap and contains) has been widely studied with relatively good performance, whereas other types of TLINK (e.g., started by, finished by, precedes) are rarely studied and remain challenging. Machine learning classifiers (such as Support Vector Machine and Conditional Random Fields) and Deep Neural Networks were among the best performing methods for extracting TLINKs, but nearly all the work has been carried out and tested on two publicly available corpora only. The field would benefit from the availability of more publicly available, high-quality, annotated clinical text corpora.','Alfattni G and Peek N and Nenadic G','Journal of biomedical informatics',NULL,''),(271,2,'27194315','27194315','Health effects of training laypeople to deliver emergency care in underserviced populations: a systematic review protocol.','INTRODUCTION: The Disease Control Priorities Project recommends emergency care training for laypersons in low-resource settings, but evidence for these interventions has not yet been systematically reviewed.

We examined methods of assessing the treatment burden experienced by this population as a first step to identifying strategies to reduce it. METHODS: Systematic searches were performed of the peer-reviewed and grey-literature (PubMed, Cochrane library, CINAHL, EMBASE, Web of Science, SCOPUS, New York Academy of Medicine Grey Literature Review, NLM catalog and ProQuest Digital Theses and Dissertations). After title and abstract screening, both qualitative and quantitative articles describing approaches to assessment of treatment burden were included. RESULTS: Forty-five articles from the peer reviewed and three items from the grey literature were identified. Most articles (34/48) discussed treatment burden associated with a specific condition. All but one examined the treatment burden experienced by patients and six addressed the treatment burden experienced by caregivers. Qualitative studies revealed many aspects of treatment burden including the burdens of understanding the condition, juggling, monitoring and adjusting treatments, efforts to engage with others for support as well as financial and time burdens. Many tools to assess treatment burden in different populations were identified through the qualitative data. The most commonly used instrument was the Treatment Burden Questionnaire. CONCLUSIONS: Many instruments are available to assess treatment burden, but no one standardized assessment method was identified. Few articles examined approaches to measuring the treatment burden experienced by caregivers. As people live longer with more chronic conditions healthcare providers need to identify patients and caregivers burdened by treatment and engage in approaches to ameliorate treatment burden. A standard and validated assessment method to measure treatment burden in the clinical setting would help to enhance the care of people with multiple chronic conditions, allow comparison of different approaches to reducing treatment burden, and foster ongoing evaluation and monitoring of burden across conditions, patient populations, and time.','Sheehan OC and Leff B and Ritchie CS and Garrigues SK and Li L and Saliba D and Fathi R and Boyd CM','BMC geriatrics',NULL,'Caregivers/psychology/*standards,Chronic Disease/psychology/*therapy,*Cost of Illness,Health Personnel/psychology/standards,Humans,*Patient Satisfaction,*Qualitative Research,Surveys and Questionnaires,Treatment Outcome'),(273,2,'31366656','31366656','Impact of botanical fermented foods on metabolic biomarkers and gut microbiota in adults with metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes: a systematic review protocol.','INTRODUCTION: Dysfunctional gut microbiota is a common finding in patients with metabolic syndrome (MetS) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

Diet has been identified as a modifiable risk factor and opportunity for intervention in many physical illnesses and more recently in mental illnesses such as unipolar depression; however, no dietary guidelines exist for patients with SSD. OBJECTIVE: This review sought to systematically scope the existing literature in order to identify nutritional interventions for the prevention or treatment of mental health symptoms in SSD as well as gaps and opportunities for further research. METHODS: This review followed established methodological approaches for scoping reviews including an extensive a priori search strategy and duplicate screening. Because of the large volume of results, an online program (Abstrackr) was used for screening and tagging. Data were extracted based on the dietary constituents and analyzed. RESULTS: Of 55,330 results identified by the search, 822 studies met the criteria for inclusion. Observational evidence shows a connection between the presence of psychotic disorders and poorer quality dietary patterns, higher intake of refined carbohydrates and total fat, and lower intake or levels of fibre, omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, vegetables, fruit, and certain vitamins and minerals (vitamin B12 and B6, folate, vitamin C, zinc, and selenium). Evidence illustrates a role of food allergy and sensitivity as well as microbiome composition and specific phytonutrients (such as L-theanine, sulforaphane, and resveratrol). Experimental studies have demonstrated benefit using healthy diet patterns and specific vitamins and minerals (vitamin B12 and B6, folate, and zinc) and amino acids (serine, lysine, glycine, and tryptophan). DISCUSSION: Overall, these findings were consistent with many other bodies of knowledge about healthy dietary patterns. Many limitations exist related to the design of the individual studies and the ability to extrapolate the results of studies using dietary supplements to dietary interventions (food). Dietary recommendations are presented as well as recommendations for further research including more prospective observational studies and intervention studies that modify diet constituents or entire dietary patterns with statistical power to detect mental health outcomes.','Aucoin M and LaChance L and Cooley K and Kidd S','Neuropsychobiology',NULL,''),(275,2,'32451701','32451701','Nutrition interventions to improve the appetite of adults undergoing cancer treatment: a systematic review.','PURPOSE: Loss of appetite is a common side effect of cancer and cancer treatments resulting in risk of malnutrition and cancer cachexia. This review aimed to systematically determine nutrition interventions that improve appetite and nutrition-related outcomes of adults with cancer undergoing cancer treatments, and to identify appetite assessment tools used to measure appetite. METHODS: Inclusion criteria included randomised controlled trials of adults with cancer undergoing chemotherapy, radiotherapy or immunotherapy treatments, nutrition interventions and appetite assessed by an appetite assessment tool or quality of life tool. The search strategy was applied to four databases and two researchers systematically assessed for eligibility. Following data extraction, quality of the included library was assessed using the Quality Criteria Checklist: Primary Research. A narrative synthesis of results was undertaken. RESULTS: After title/abstract screening, 24 full texts were assessed for eligibility; five trials of n = 472 participants were included in the final library. Nutrition interventions that improved appetite were oral nutrition supplements, fish oil supplements and dietary counselling. Appetite was assessed via visual analogue scales (n = 1) and EORTC QLQ C30 questionnaire (n = 4). Quality was assessed as neutral in 2 studies and positive in 3 studies. CONCLUSION: The use of oral nutrition supplements and dietary counselling and increases in EPA from fish oil supplementation improved the appetite and nutrition outcomes of patients with cancer undergoing cancer treatments.

This first systematic literature review led to identification of 51 hypodysfibrinogenemic cases. Diagnosis based only on functional/antigenic fibrinogen ratio may be insufficient. Family studies show an incomplete segregation of mutation with the clinical phenotypes. SUMMARY: Background Hypodysfibrinogenemia is a rare disease characterized by decreased levels of a dysfunctional fibrinogen. It shares features with both hypo- and dysfibrinogenemia, although with specific molecular patterns and clinical phenotypes. Objectives To better define the genetics, the diagnosis and the clinical features of hypodysfibrinogenemia. Patients/Methods A systematic literature search led to 167 records. After removal of duplicates, abstract screening and full-text reviewing, 56 molecular and/or clinical studies were analyzed, including a novel FGB missense mutation in a woman with a mild bleeding phenotype. Results A total of 32 single causative mutations were reported, mainly in the COOH-terminal region of the gamma or Aalpha chains at heterozygous or homozygous state. Seven additional hypodysfibrinogenemias were due to compound heterozygosity. The hypofibrinogenemic phenotypes were a result of an impaired assembly or secretion or an increased clearance of the fibrinogen variant, whereas the dysfibrinogenemic phenotype was mainly a result of a defective fibrin polymerization and an abnormal calcium or tPA binding. Among 51 identified index cases, a functional/antigenic fibrinogen ratio < 0.7 had a sensitivity of 86% for the diagnosis of hypodysfibrinogenemia. Eleven patients (22%) were asymptomatic at time of diagnosis, 23 (45%) had a mild bleeding phenotype with mainly obstetrical or gynecologic-related hemorrhage and 22 (43%) had experienced at least one thrombotic event, including 23 venous and eight arterial thromboses. Conclusions This first systematic review on hypodysfibrinogenemia shows the heterogeneity of causative mutations and that misdiagnosis could occur in relation to the functional and antigenic fibrinogen levels.

Acellular dermal matrices (ADMs) have been used for the reconstruction of the lower pole due to many advantages; however, its cost is seen as a major drawback in this era of concern for the allocation of health-care funds. Recently, polyglactin 910 (Vicryl; Ethicon, Somerville, NJ, USA) mesh has been published as an alternative. We assessed the published literature, in particular investigating for studies that compare Vicryl mesh with ADM. METHODS: We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) methodology. Searched databases included Medline/PubMed, Cochrane Reviews, Embase, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials, and SCOPUS. Search criteria were as follows: (1) reporting of clinical data using Vicryl mesh in breast reconstruction, (2) reporting of original data, and (3) outcome of interest reported. RESULTS: We retrieved 290 de-duplicated articles. After title and abstract screening, we dismissed 258 articles, and thus full text was reviewed for 32 articles; only three retrospective articles met inclusion criteria. The total population included 112 patients and 156 breasts. The reported incidence of complications was as follows: infection 2.6% (confidence interval (CI): 0.7-6.6%), reconstruction failure 3.2% (CI: 1.0-7%), and seroma 1.3% (CI: 0.2-4.6%).

Part 1 of this article shows the methodology and the results of the appraisal, part 2 (to be published) shows the key topics which should be dealt with in a german guideline on bronchial asthma. OBJECTIVES: To identify and compare evidence-based, high-quality German- and English language asthma guidelines as benchmarks for ongoing guideline development and implementation programmes. To disseminate information about asthma guidelines developed in accordance with current methodological know-how. To identify and consent key topics for a national evidence-based guideline for Germany. METHODS: Search procedure, formal appraisal: Systematic search using literature databases (XMED, incl. Medline and Embase) and English-/German-language guideline databases (via www. leitlinien.de), published between January 1990 and March 2000. Abstract screening of the search results according to the inclusion criteria (n = 54 of a total of 502 hits). Methodological guideline evaluation of 16 guidelines using the German checklist for methodological guideline appraisal. Appraisal of guidelines\' contents: Peer review of guidelines with the following inclusion criteria: Bronchial Asthma-general, German and English language, based in references published later than 1994, new guideline or actual update. Peer review was performed by a multidisciplinary focus group of EBM experts (clinical and ambulatory settings). No expert was involved in guideline production during the review period. RESULTS: Methodological appraisal: 16 out of guidelines were in accordance with the formal minimal standard with a wide range within the following domains: \"description of the development process\", \"declaration of authors\' independence\", \"explicit link between recommendations and the supporting evidence\", \"management options\", \"tools for implementation\". The focus group recommended for future national asthma guidelines to rely on the following procedures: (1) to formulate the recommendations using standardized, clearly described consensus methods basing on evidence retrieved and selected in a systematic way (2) to prove links between recommendations and supporting evidence (3) to develop guideline versions for health care professionals as well as for consumer/patients (4) to develop guideline-based education tools (5) to ensure periodical updates of the asthma guideline (6) to consider the methodological recommendations and to give reasons for deviations from the methodological recommendations. APPRAISAL OF GUIDELINES CONTENT: None of the guidelines identified comprised information about all of the following key topics considered to be relevant for a German national guideline by the focus group: (1) intended guideline users/goals, (2) definition (3) cause of disease, (4) form of disease, (5) severity, (6) diagnosis, (7) therapeutic goals, (8) prevention, (9) pharmacotherapy, (10) non-pharmacotherapy, (11) therapy control and compliance, (12) emergency treatment, (13) rehabilitation, (14) comorbidity, (15) special aspects, (16) coordination of care, (17) quality assurance/quality management, (18) implementation. SUMMARY POINTS: For quality promotion of bronchial asthma management in Germany, the development of a national evidence-based guideline, using the internationally accepted quality criteria for clinical practice guidelines, was recommended by an expert group of the German Guideline Clearinghouse. The experts identified and peer-reviewed 16 out of 54 guidelines, which might be useful as benchmarks and examples for a German asthma guideline. From the peer review results, the expert group identified 18 key topics for a national asthma guideline.','Thole H and Weingart O and Lampert U and Bassler D and Fessler J and Forster J and Franzen D and Geraedts M and Kroegel C and Morike K and Schmitz M and Scholz R and Teske S and Ollenschlager G','Pneumologie (Stuttgart, Germany)',NULL,'Asthma/*prevention & control,Databases, Factual,Germany,Health Promotion/*standards,Humans,MEDLINE,Quality Assurance, Health Care'),(279,2,'28687344','28687344','Anterior cervical discectomy and fusion versus posterior laminoplasty for multilevel cervical myelopathy: A meta-analysis.','OBJECT: Anterior cervical discectomy with fusion (ACDF) and laminoplasty (LAMP) are used for the treatment of multilevel cervical myelopathy. Despite their widespread applications certain differences are noted between the ACDF and LAMP procedures. A meta-analysis was conducted in order to compare the clinical outcomes, complications, and surgical trauma between ACDF and LAMP for the treatment of multilevel cervical myelopathy. METHODS: Medline, EMBASE, Google Scholar, and Cochrane databases were used for the search of relevant studies until September 2016. The studies aimed to compare the ACDF and LAMP procedures for the treatment of multilevel cervical myelopathy. Title and abstract screening was carried out concomitantly, whereas full text screening was carried out independently. A random effect model was used for heterogeneous data. The data that did not follow heterogeneous pattern were pooled by a fixed effect model in order to examine the mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes and the odds ratio (OR) for dichotomous outcomes, respectively. RESULTS: A total of 6 articles out of 1351 citations (379 participants) were eligible. Significant differences were noted between the two groups in the cobb angle of C2-C7 (MD = 4.00, 95%, CI = 0.83 to 7.17; p = 0.01) and with regard to the incidence of associated complications (OR = 3.61, 95%, CI = 1.72 to 7.59; p = 0.0007). However, no apparent differences were noted in the variables blood loss (MD = -24.16, 95% CI = -174.47 to 126.15; p = 0.75), operation time ((MD = 32.81, 95% CI = -26.76 to 92.38; p = 0.28), recovery rate of JOA score (MD = 4.00, 95%, CI = 0.83 to 7.17; p = 0.01) and incidence of associated complications (OR = 3.61, 95%, CI = 1.72 to 7.59). CONCLUSIONS: The present meta-analysis demonstrates that the rate of complications is lower in the laminoplasty. However, the cobb angle of C2-C7 was decreased in the ACDF group at the final follow-up period compared with the baseline. The outcomes of the variables blood loss, operation time, range of motion and recovery rate of JOA score, were similar in the two groups.','Xu L and Sun H and Li Z and Liu X and Xu G','International journal of surgery (London, England)',NULL,'Blood Loss, Surgical,Cervical Vertebrae/*surgery,Diskectomy/*methods,Humans,Laminoplasty/*methods,Operative Time,Postoperative Complications,Spinal Cord Diseases/*surgery,*Spinal Fusion'),(280,2,'32005778','32005778','Do mobile device apps designed to support medication adherence demonstrate efficacy? A systematic review of randomised controlled trials, with meta-analysis.','OBJECTIVES: To estimate the efficacy of app-based interventions designed to support medication adherence and investigate which behaviour change techniques (BCTs) used by the apps are associated with efficacy. DESIGN: Systematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs), with meta-analysis. SETTING: Medline/PubMed, PsycINFO, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Embase and Web of Science were searched from 1990 to November 2018 for RCTs conducted in any healthcare setting. PARTICIPANTS: Studies of participants of any age taking prescribed medication for any health condition and for any duration. INTERVENTION: An app-based intervention delivered through a smartphone, tablet computer or personal digital assistant to help, support or advise about medication adherence. COMPARATOR: One of (1) usual care, (2) a control app which did not use any BCTs to improve medication adherence or (3) a non-app-based comparator. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the pooled effect size of changes in medication adherence. The secondary outcome was the association between BCTs used by the apps and the effect size. RESULTS: The initial search identified 13 259 citations. After title and abstract screening, full-text articles of 83 studies were screened for eligibility. Nine RCTs with 1159 recruited participants were included. The mean age of participants was >50 years in all but one study. Health conditions of target populations included cardiovascular disease, depression, Parkinson\'s disease, psoriasis and multimorbidity. The meta-analysis indicated that patients who use mobile apps to support them in taking medications are more likely to self-report adherence to medications (OR 2.120, 95% CI 1.635 to 2.747, n=988) than those in the comparator groups. Meta-regression of the BCTs did not reveal any significant associations with effect size. CONCLUSIONS: App-based medication adherence interventions may have a positive effect on patient adherence. Larger scale studies are required to further evaluate this effect, including long-term sustainability, and intervention and participant characteristics that are associated with efficacy and app usage.

However, it is a heterogeneous condition with inter-related factors including ethnicity, body mass index and gestational weight gain significantly modifying the absolute risk of complications at an individual level. Predicting the risk of pregnancy complications for an individual woman with GDM presents a useful adjunct to therapeutic decision-making and patient education. Diagnostic prediction models for GDM are prevalent. In contrast, prediction models for risk of complications in those with GDM are relatively novel. This study will systematically review published prognostic prediction models for pregnancy complications in women with GDM, describe their characteristics, compare performance and assess methodological quality and applicability. METHODS: Studies will be identified by searching MEDLINE and Embase electronic databases. Title and abstract screening, full-text review and data extraction will be completed independently by two reviewers. The included studies will be systematically assessed for risk of bias and applicability using appropriate tools designed for prediction modelling studies. Extracted data will be tabulated to facilitate qualitative comparison of published prediction models. Quantitative data on predictive performance of these models will be synthesised with meta-analyses if appropriate. DISCUSSION: This review will identify and summarise all published prognostic prediction models for pregnancy complications in women with GDM. We will compare model performance across different settings and populations with meta-analysis if appropriate. This work will guide subsequent phases in the prognosis research framework: further model development, external validation and model updating, and impact assessment. The ultimate model will estimate the absolute risk of pregnancy complications for women with GDM and will be implemented into routine care as an evidence-based GDM complication risk prediction model. It is anticipated to offer value to women and their clinicians with individualised risk assessment and may assist decision-making. Ultimately, this systematic review is an important step towards a personalised risk-stratified model-of-care for GDM to allow preventative and therapeutic interventions for the maximal benefit to women and their offspring, whilst sparing expense and harm for those at low risk.

Objective: To summarize the estimate of attrition prevalence among general surgery residents. Data Sources: We searched the Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane, PsycINFO, and ERIC databases (January 1, 1946, to October 22, 2015) for studies reporting on the prevalence and causes of attrition in surgical residents, as well as the characteristics and destinations of residents who left general surgery training programs. Database searches were conducted on October 22, 2015. Study Selection: Eligibility criteria included all studies reporting on the primary (attrition prevalence) or secondary (causes of attrition and characteristics and destination of residents who leave residency programs) outcomes in peer-reviewed journals. Commentaries, reviews, and studies reporting on preliminary surgery programs were excluded. Of the 41 full-text articles collected from the title/abstract screening, 22 studies (53.7%) met the selection criteria. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Two reviewers independently collected and summarized the data. We calculated pooled estimates using random effects meta-analyses where appropriate. Main Outcome and Measure: Attrition prevalence of general surgery residents. Results: Overall, we included 22 studies that reported on residents (n = 19821) from general surgery programs. The pooled estimate for the overall attrition prevalence among general surgery residents was 18% (95% CI, 14%-21%), with significant between-study variation (I2 = 96.8%; P < .001). Attrition was significantly higher among female compared with male (25% vs 15%, respectively; P = .008) general surgery residents, and most residents left after their first postgraduate year (48%; 95% CI, 39%-57%). Departing residents often relocated to another general surgery program (20%; 95% CI, 15%-24%) or switched to anesthesia (13%; 95% CI, 11%-16%) and other specialties. The most common reported causes of attrition were uncontrollable lifestyle (range, 12%-87.5%) and transferring to another specialty (range, 19%-38.9%). Conclusions and Relevance: General surgery programs have relatively high attrition, with female residents more likely to leave their training programs than male residents. Residents most often relocate or switch to another specialty after the first postgraduate year owing to lifestyle-related issues.','Khoushhal Z and Hussain MA and Greco E and Mamdani M and Verma S and Rotstein O and Tricco AC and Al-Omran M','JAMA surgery',NULL,'Career Choice,General Surgery/*education/*statistics & numerical data,Humans,Internship and Residency/*statistics & numerical data,Life Style,Personnel Turnover/*statistics & numerical data,Sex Factors,Work-Life Balance'),(284,2,'27151430','27151430','Is aspirin use associated with a decreased risk of ovarian cancer? A systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies with dose-response analysis.','OBJECTIVE: Currently available epidemiologic evidences concerning the chemopreventive effect of aspirin on ovarian cancer are inconsistent. Therefore, we aimed to further explore the association by synthesizing evidence from population-based studies. METHODS: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Scopus using key words and controlled vocabularies. Title/abstract screening, full-text review, data extraction, and quality assessment were performed independently by reviewers, and a random-effects model was utilized for meta-analysis. Subgroup analysis was conducted based on study locale, and sensitivity analysis was performed by synthesizing studies that adjusted for certain covariates or studies with good quality. Dose-response relation was assessed by a two-stage linear dose-response model. Statistical heterogeneity was evaluated by the I-squared value and a chi-squared test for the Cochrane Q statistic. RESULTS: We identified 8 cohort studies and 15 case-control studies. In overall meta-analysis of risk ratios (RRs) of binary exposure, the synthesized RR was 0.89 (95% CI, 0.83-0.96), and no substantial statistical heterogeneity was observed (I(2)=22.5%, PCochrane=0.168). After stratification by study design, the synthesized RR was 0.85 (95% CI, 0.77-0.94) and 0.95 (95% CI, 0.85-1.05) for case-control and cohort studies, respectively. In sensitivity analysis, the synthesized estimate of long-term use was not statistically significant, whereas the effect measure (RRmeta=0.60, 95% CI, 0.39-0.93) was significant by synthesizing RRs of the highest frequency of use from 2 cohort studies. The dose-response analysis showed an inverse significant association between aspirin use and the risk (RRper 1time/wk=0.94, 95% CI, 0.89-1.00; n=2). Egger\'s tests showed that publication bias existed for overall meta-analysis, meta-analysis for case-control studies, and studies conducted in the United States. CONCLUSION: In summary, our study suggests that aspirin can reduce the risk of ovarian cancer.

DATA SOURCES: Literature searches were updated in electronic databases (n=3), conference proceedings (n=3), and Food and Drug Administration transcripts. Multiple sources (n=13) were searched for potential gray literature. A primary source for current survival evidence was a recently published individual patient data meta-analysis. In that meta-analysis, patient data were obtained from investigators for studies enrolling more than 50 patients per arm. Because those data constitute the most currently available data for this update, as well as the source for on-study (active treatment) mortality data, we limited inclusion in the current report to studies enrolling more than 50 patients per arm to avoid potential differential endpoint ascertainment in smaller studies. REVIEW METHODS: Title and abstract screening was performed by one or two (to resolve uncertainty) reviewers; potentially included publications were reviewed in full text. Two or three (to resolve disagreements) reviewers assessed trial quality. Results were independently verified and pooled for outcomes of interest. The balance of benefits and harms was examined in a decision model. RESULTS: We evaluated evidence from 5 trials directly comparing darbepoetin with epoetin, 41 trials comparing epoetin with control, and 8 trials comparing darbepoetin with control; 5 trials evaluated early versus late (delay until Hb </=9 to 11 g/dL) treatment. Trials varied according to duration, tumor types, cancer therapy, trial quality, iron supplementation, baseline hemoglobin, ESA dosing frequency (and therefore amount per dose), and dose escalation. ESAs decreased the risk of transfusion (pooled relative risk [RR], 0.58; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.53 to 0.64; I(2) = 51%; 38 trials) without evidence of meaningful difference between epoetin and darbepoetin. Thromboembolic event rates were higher in ESA-treated patients (pooled RR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.30 to 1.74; I(2) = 0%; 37 trials) without difference between epoetin and darbepoetin. In 14 trials reporting the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT)-Fatigue subscale, the most common patient-reported outcome, scores decreased by -0.6 in control arms (95% CI, -6.4 to 5.2; I(2) = 0%) and increased by 2.1 in ESA arms (95% CI, -3.9 to 8.1; I(2) = 0%). There were fewer thromboembolic and on-study mortality adverse events when ESA treatment was delayed until baseline Hb was less than 10 g/dL, in keeping with current treatment practice, but the difference in effect from early treatment was not significant, and the evidence was limited and insufficient for conclusions. No evidence informed optimal duration of therapy. Mortality was increased during the on-study period (pooled hazard ratio [HR], 1.17; 95% CI, 1.04 to 1.31; I(2) = 0%; 37 trials). There was one additional death for every 59 treated patients when the control arm on-study mortality was 10 percent and one additional death for every 588 treated patients when the control-arm on-study mortality was 1 percent. A cohort decision model yielded a consistent result-greater loss of life-years when control arm on-study mortality was higher. There was no discernible increase in mortality with ESA use over the longest available followup (pooled HR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.99 to 1.10; I(2) = 38%; 44 trials), but many trials did not include an overall survival endpoint and potential time-dependent confounding was not considered. CONCLUSIONS: Results of this update were consistent with the 2006 review. ESAs reduced the need for transfusions and increased the risk of thromboembolism. FACT-Fatigue scores were better with ESA use but the magnitude was less than the minimal clinically important difference. An increase in mortality accompanied the use of ESAs. An important unanswered question is whether dosing practices and overall ESA exposure might influence harms.','Grant MD and Piper M and Bohlius J and Tonia T and Robert N and Vats V and Bonnell C and Ziegler KM and Aronson N','',NULL,''),(286,2,'32835497','32835497','Barriers and facilitators of physical activity participation in adults living with type 1 diabetes: A systematic scoping review.','To identify and map barriers and facilitators of physical activity (PA) in adults living with type 1 diabetes (T1D) in any care setting or environment.

INTRODUCTION: Evidence suggests that improved skill development in university can reduce anxiety in practice, improving performance of skills and overall learning at clinical placement for health professions students. However, evidence indicates that the clinical environment is most effective for learning. As a result, there has been increased interest in the use of HFS where students can test knowledge and skills in an increasingly self-directed way. No previous reviews on the effectiveness of HFS on skill development in physiotherapy students were identified. INCLUSION CRITERIA: Experimental and quasi-experimental studies comparing HFS (simulated person, manikin, virtual simulation, video case-studies) to LFS (peer role-play, paper-based case-studies) in pre-registration physiotherapy education were included. Primary outcomes were objective measures of skills performance; secondary outcomes were students\' perceptions of the impact of simulation on learning measured using quantitative outcomes. METHODS: A three-step search strategy was employed. Following an initial search of MEDLINE and CINAHL and analysis of text words, MEDLINE, CINAHL, ERIC, AMED, EThOS and Google Scholar were searched in November 2017. Reference lists of studies included at critical appraisal stage were hand-searched. Studies published in English from 1978 onwards were included. Title/abstract screening, critical appraisal and data extraction were conducted by two independent reviewers; conflicts were resolved by discussion. RESULTS: Meta-analysis was not possible due to heterogeneity; therefore, results were presented in narrative form. Three randomized controlled trials (RCT) and three quasi-experimental studies (310 participants) were included. They were conducted in the USA and Australia, and evaluated standardized patients (people who take on the role of a real patient), near-peers, computerized manikins and virtual simulation in pre-registration Bachelor of Science (Honors), Master of Science and Doctor of Physiotherapy students. One RCT was considered high quality, with the remainder moderate quality. The findings related to five main areas: i) In terms of motor skills performance, an increased number of safety fails were found with HFS (HFS = 13.5% safety fails, HFS plus video feedback = 15.4% safety fails, control [LFS] = 8.1% safety fails); ii) In terms of clinical performance, the Assessment of Physiotherapy Practice (APP) tool indicated no significant improvement in mean APP scores at week 6 of clinical placement (HFS mean APP score = 60.7 [9.1], control mean APP score = 58.7 [8.4]; P = 0.35); iii) In terms of self-efficacy, only one of two studies showed a statistically significant difference with HFS, as measured by the Acute Care Confidence Survey (P = 0.001); however, became non-significant once students were on clinical placement (P = 0.328); iv) Students did not perceive a significant difference in their communication skills with HFS, as measured on a visual analogue scale (simulation = 9.05 [1.27]; control 8.75 [1.2]; P = 0.482); and v) In terms of general perceptions, students were significantly more positive about HFS for increasing awareness of safety issues (P = 0.002), patients\' emotional status (P = 0.002), handling skills (P < 0.0001) and ability to provide instructions to patients (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Currently, there is no high quality evidence that HFS improves motor skill performance in pre-registration physiotherapy students. There is a small amount of moderate-quality evidence it may improve students\' perception of their self-efficacy but no evidence that it improves communication skills. However, a lack of studies and variation in outcome measures meant that meta-analysis was not possible.

Of 258 papers identified in the literature search, 88 were potentially eligible based on abstract screening. Following evaluation of full-text articles, 35 were selected for inclusion in the review. RESULTS: Since the original trial that demonstrated the efficacy of pemetrexed and cisplatin in mesothelioma, multiple trials have been conducted that have further informed management options. Anti-angiogenesis agents such as bevacizumab and nintedanib appear promising as adjuncts to first-line chemotherapy. Meanwhile, immunotherapy, anti-mesothelin agents and molecular targeted therapies are potential areas for development, with ongoing trials promising to deliver interesting results over the next few years.

The use of multiple medications increases the potential for drug interactions and for prescription of potentially inappropriate medications. eHealth solutions are increasingly recommended in healthcare, with big data analysis techniques as a major component. In the following we use the term analysis of big data as referring to the computational analysis of large data sets to find patterns, trends, and associations in large data sets collected from a wide range of sources in contrast to using classical statistics programs. It is hypothesized that big data analysis is able to reveal patterns in patient data that would not be identifiable using conventional methods of data analysis. The aim of this review was to evaluate whether there are existing big data analysis techniques that can help to identify patients consuming multiple drugs and to assist in the reduction of polypharmacy in patients. METHODS: A computerized search was conducted in February 2019 and updated in May 2020, using the PubMed, Web of Science and Cochrane Library databases. The search strategy was defined by the principles of a systematic search, using the PICO scheme. All studies evaluating big data analytics about patients consuming multiple drugs were considered. Two researchers assessed all search results independently to identify eligible studies. The data was then extracted into standardized tables. RESULTS: A total of 327 studies were identified through the database search. After title and abstract screening, 302 items were removed. Only three studies were identified as addressing big data analysis techniques in patients with polypharmacy. One study extracted antipsychotic polypharmacy data, the second introduced a decision support system to evaluate side-effects in patients with polypharmacy and the third evaluated a decision support system to identify polypharmacy-related problems in individuals.

An umbrella systematic review of current risk prediction models for cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and hypertension.','OBJECTIVE: To provide an overview of the currently available risk prediction models (RPMs) for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), diabetes and hypertension, and to compare their effectiveness in proper recognition of patients at risk of developing these diseases. DESIGN: Umbrella systematic review. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Systematic reviews or meta-analysis examining and comparing performances of RPMs for CVDs, hypertension or diabetes in healthy adult (18-65 years old) population, published in English language. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Data were extracted according to the following parameters: number of studies included, intervention (RPMs applied/assessed), comparison, performance, validation and outcomes. A narrative synthesis was performed. Data were reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. STUDY SELECTION: 3612 studies were identified. After title/abstract screening and removal of duplicate articles, 37 studies met the eligibility criteria. After reading the full text, 13 were deemed relevant for inclusion. Three further papers from the reference lists of these articles were then added. STUDY APPRAISAL: The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using the AMSTAR tool. RISK OF BIAS IN INDIVIDUAL STUDIES: Risk of Bias evaluation was carried out using the ROBIS tool. RESULTS: Sixteen studies met the inclusion criteria: six focused on diabetes, two on hypertension and eight on CVDs. Globally, prediction models for diabetes and hypertension showed no significant difference in effectiveness. Conversely, some promising differences among prediction tools were highlighted for CVDs. The Ankle-Brachial Index, in association with the Framingham tool, and QRISK scores provided some evidence of a certain superiority compared with Framingham alone. LIMITATIONS: Due to the significant heterogeneity of the studies, it was not possible to perform a meta-analysis. The electronic search was limited to studies in English and to three major international databases (MEDLINE/PubMed, Scopus and Cochrane Library), with additional works derived from the reference list of other studies; grey literature with unpublished documents was not included in the search. Furthermore, no assessment of potential adverse effects of RPMs was carried out. CONCLUSIONS: Consistent evidence is available only for CVD prediction: the Framingham score, alone or in combination with the Ankle-Brachial Index, and the QRISK score can be confirmed as the gold standard. Further efforts should not be concentrated on creating new scores, but rather on performing external validation of the existing ones, in particular on high-risk groups. Benefits could be further improved by supplementing existing models with information on lifestyle, personal habits, family and employment history, social network relationships, income and education.

This has resulted in difficulties in the lives of those affected. PURPOSE: This literature review was conducted to understand the concept, causes, and determinants of stigma in leprosy. METHOD: Electronic searches were undertaken using PubMed (Medline), CINAHL and PsycInfo databases. The internet was searched through Google Scholar for papers not found in these databases. The main inclusion criteria were papers related to stigma or leprosy written in Thai or English. RESULTS: After searching the databases, 84 papers were identified, 3 were removed because of duplication and parallel publication, and 20 were removed on abstract screening. After reading 61 full papers, 7 were excluded. Finally, 54 were included in this review. It was found that the concept of stigma involves not only characteristics considered undesirable, but also the social context of the individual or group. Reported causes and determinants of stigma related to leprosy are the external manifestations of the disease, cultural and religious beliefs, fear of transmission, association with people considered inferior and public health-related interventions. CONCLUSION: Stigma is a complex phenomenon that has multiple causes, often linked to the cultural context in which it occurs. Despite this, many similarities were found in leprosy-related stigma across countries and cultures, which would facilitate the development of interventions.','Sermrittirong S and Van Brakel WH','Leprosy review',NULL,'Culture,Databases, Factual,Fear,Humans,Leprosy/*psychology,*Social Stigma'),(292,2,'32063258','32063258','Patient race, ethnicity, and care in the emergency department: A scoping review.','OBJECTIVES: Health disparities between racial and ethnic groups have been documented in Canada, the United States, and Australia. Despite evidence that differences in emergency department (ED) care based on patient race and ethnicity exist, there are no comprehensive literature reviews in this area. The objective of this review is to provide an overview of the literature on the impact of patient ethnicity and race on the processes of ED care. METHODS: A scoping review was conducted to capture the broad nature of the literature. A database search was conducted in MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL Plus, Social Sciences Citation Index, SCOPUS, and JSTOR. Five journals and reference lists of included articles were hand searched. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were defined iteratively to ensure literature captured was relevant to our research question. Data were extracted using predetermined variables, and additional extraction variables were added as familiarity with the literature developed. RESULTS: Searching yielded 1,157 citations, reduced to 153 following removal of duplicates, and title and abstract screening. After full-text screening, 83 articles were included. Included articles report that, in EDs, patient race and ethnicity impact analgesia, triage scores, wait times, treatments, diagnostic procedure utilization, rates of patients leaving without being seen, and patient subjective experiences. Authors of included studies propose a variety of possible causes for these disparities. CONCLUSIONS: Further research on the existence of disparities in care within EDs is warranted to explore the causes behind observed disparities for particular health conditions and population groups in specific contexts.','Owens A and Holroyd BR and McLane P','CJEM',NULL,''),(293,2,'32878649','32878649','Relationship between volume and outcome for gastroschisis: a systematic review protocol.','BACKGROUND: Gastroschisis is a congenital anomaly that needs surgical management for repositioning intestines into the abdominal cavity and for abdominal closure. Higher hospital or surgeon volume has previously been found to be associated with better clinical outcomes for different especially high-risk, low volume procedures. Therefore, we aim to examine the relationship between hospital or surgeon volume and outcomes for gastroschisis. METHODS: We will perform a systematic literature search from inception onwards in Medline, Embase, CENTRAL, CINAHL, and Biosis Previews without applying any limitations. In addition, we will search trial registries and relevant conference proceedings. We will include (cluster-) randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and prospective or retrospective cohort studies analyzing the relationship between hospital or surgeon volume and clinical outcomes. The primary outcomes will be survival and mortality. Secondary outcomes will be different measures of morbidity (e.g., severe gastrointestinal complications, gastrointestinal dysfunctions, and sepsis), quality of life, and length of stay. We will systematically assess risk of bias of included studies using RoB 2 for individually or cluster-randomized trials and ROBINS-I for cohort studies, and extract data on the study design, patient characteristics, case-mix adjustments, statistical methods, hospital and surgeon volume, and outcomes into standardized tables. Title and abstract screening, full text screening, critical appraisal, and data extraction of results will be conducted by two reviewers independently. Other data will be extracted by one reviewer and checked for accuracy by a second one. Any disagreements will be resolved by discussion. We will not pool results statistically as we expect included studies to be clinically and methodologically very diverse. We will conduct a systematic synthesis without meta-analysis and use GRADE for assessing the certainty of the evidence. DISCUSSION: Given the lack of a comprehensive summary of findings on the relationship between hospital or surgeon volume and outcomes for gastroschisis, this systematic review will put things right. Results can be used to inform decision makers or clinicians and to adapt medical care.

DATA SOURCES: A systematic literature search was performed on PubMed to identify studies that have attempted to validate crowdsourcing as a method for assessing surgical skill. Through a combination of abstract screening and full-length review, 9 studies that met the inclusion criteria were reviewed. CONCLUSIONS: Crowdsourcing has been validated as an important way to provide feedback for surgical skill. It has been demonstrated to be effective in both dry-lab and live surgery, for a variety of tasks and methods.

We examined the performance of text mining in supporting the second reviewer in a systematic review examining associations between fault attribution and health and work-related outcomes after transport injury. METHODS: Citations were independently screened in Abstrackr in full (reviewer 1; 10 559 citations), and until no more citations were predicted to be relevant (reviewer 2; 1809 citations, 17.1%). All potentially relevant full-text articles were assessed by reviewer 1 (555 articles). Reviewer 2 used text mining (Wordstat, QDA Miner) to reduce assessment to full-text articles containing >/=1 fault-related exposure term (367 articles, 66.1%). RESULTS: Abstrackr offered excellent workload savings: 82.7% of citations did not require screening by reviewer 2, and total screening time was reduced by 36.6% compared with traditional dual screening of all citations. Abstrackr predictions had high specificity (83.7%), and low false negatives (0.3%), but overestimated citation relevance, probably due to the complexity of the review with multiple outcomes and high imbalance of relevant to irrelevant records, giving low sensitivity (29.7%) and precision (14.5%). Text mining of full-text articles reduced the number needing to be screened by 33.9%, and reduced total full-text screening time by 38.7% compared with traditional dual screening. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, text mining offered important benefits to systematic review workflow, but should not replace full screening by one reviewer, especially for complex reviews examining multiple health or injury outcomes.

Objective: To perform a systematic review to identify audiologic thresholds (in dB HL) that could serve as an audiologic candidacy criterion for pediatric cochlear implantation using 4 domains of speech and language development as independent outcome measures (speech production, speech perception, receptive language, and auditory performance). Evidence Review: PubMed and Embase databases were searched up to June 28, 2017, to identify studies comparing speech and language development between children who were profoundly deaf using cochlear implants and children with severe hearing loss using hearing aids, because no studies are available directly comparing children with severe HI in both groups. If cochlear implant users with profound HI score better on speech and language tests than those with severe HI who use hearing aids, this outcome could support adjusting cochlear implantation candidacy criteria to lower audiologic thresholds. Literature search, screening, and article selection were performed using a predefined strategy. Article screening was executed independently by 4 authors in 2 pairs; consensus on article inclusion was reached by discussion between these 4 authors. This study is reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) statement. Findings: Title and abstract screening of 2822 articles resulted in selection of 130 articles for full-text review. Twenty-one studies were selected for critical appraisal, resulting in selection of 10 articles for data extraction. Two studies formulated audiologic thresholds (in dB HLs) at which children could qualify for cochlear implantation: (1) at 4-frequency pure-tone average (PTA) thresholds of 80 dB HL or greater based on speech perception and auditory performance subtests and (2) at PTA thresholds of 88 and 96 dB HL based on a speech perception subtest. In 8 of the 18 outcome measures, children with profound HI using cochlear implants performed similarly to children with severe HI using hearing aids. Better performance of cochlear implant users was shown with a picture-naming test and a speech perception in noise test. Owing to large heterogeneity in study population and selected tests, it was not possible to conduct a meta-analysis. Conclusions and Relevance: Studies indicate that lower audiologic thresholds (>/=80 dB HL) than are advised in current national and manufacturer guidelines would be appropriate as audiologic candidacy criteria for pediatric cochlear implantation.','de Kleijn JL and van Kalmthout LWM and van der Vossen MJB and Vonck BMD and Topsakal V and Bruijnzeel H','JAMA otolaryngology-- head & neck surgery',NULL,'Audiometry, Pure-Tone,*Auditory Threshold,Child,*Cochlear Implantation,Deafness/*diagnosis/rehabilitation/*surgery,Hearing Aids,Humans,*Patient Selection,Speech Perception'),(297,2,'29132353','29132353','The effectiveness of community-based coordinating interventions in dementia care: a meta-analysis and subgroup analysis of intervention components.','BACKGROUND: Interventions aiming to coordinate services for the community-based dementia population vary in components, organisation and implementation. In this review we aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of community-based care coordinating interventions on health outcomes and investigate whether specific components of interventions influence their effects. METHODS: We searched four databases from inception to April 2017: Medline, The Cochrane Library, EMBASE and PsycINFO. This was aided by a search of four grey literature databases, and backward and forward citation tracking of included papers. Title and abstract screening was followed by a full text screen by two independent reviewers, and quality was assessed using the CASP appraisal tool. We then conducted meta-analyses and subgroup analyses. RESULTS: A total of 14 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving 10,372 participants were included in the review. Altogether we carried out 12 meta-analyses and 19 subgroup analyses. Meta-analyses found coordinating interventions showed a statistically significant improvement in both patient behaviour measured using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) (mean difference (MD) = -9.5; 95% confidence interval (CI): -18.1 to -1.0; p = 0.03; number of studies (n) = 4; I(2) = 88%) and caregiver burden (standardised mean difference (SMD) = -0.54; 95% CI: -1.01 to -0.07; p = 0.02; n = 5, I(2) = 92%) compared to the control group. Subgroup analyses found interventions using a case manager with a nursing background showed a greater positive effect on caregiver quality of life than those that used case managers from other professional backgrounds (SMD = 0.94 versus 0.03, respectively; p < 0.001). Interventions that did not provide supervision for the case managers showed greater effectiveness for reducing the percentage of patients that are institutionalised compared to those that provided supervision (odds ratio (OR) = 0.27 versus 0.96 respectively; p = 0.02). There was little evidence of effects on other outcomes, or that other intervention components modify the intervention effects. CONCLUSION: Results show that coordinating interventions in dementia care has a positive impact on some outcomes, namely patient behaviour and caregiver burden, but the evidence is inconsistent and results were not strong enough to draw definitive conclusions on general effectiveness. With the rising prevalence of dementia, effective complex interventions will be necessary to provide high quality and effective care for patients, and facilitate collaboration of health, social and third sector services.','Backhouse A and Ukoumunne OC and Richards DA and McCabe R and Watkins R and Dickens C','BMC health services research',NULL,'Caregivers,*Community Mental Health Services,Dementia/*nursing,Humans,*Long-Term Care,Quality of Life,Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic,Treatment Outcome'),(298,2,'31141558','31141558','Risk factors for human leptospirosis following flooding: A meta-analysis of observational studies.','Leptospirosis is probably the most widespread zoonotic disease in the world especially in tropical countries. There has been an increase in individual studies, which assessed the frequency of leptospirosis in flood conditions. Some studies showed contact with floods was significantly associated with the occurrence of leptospirosis while other studies reported differently. The objective of this meta-analysis was to synthesize the evidence on the risk factors which are associated with human leptospirosis following flooding. We set up the inclusion criteria and searched for the original studies, addressing leptospirosis in human with related to flood in health-related electronic databases including PubMed, Embase, Ovid Medline, google scholar and Scopus sources. We used the terms \'leptospirosis\', \'flood\', \'risk factor\' and terms from the categories were connected with \"OR\" within each category and by \"AND\" between categories. The initial search yielded 557 citations. After the title and abstract screening, 49 full-text papers were reviewed and a final of 18 observational studies met the pre-specified inclusion criteria. Overall, the pooled estimates of 14 studies showed that the contact with flooding was a significant factor for the occurrence of leptospirosis (pooled OR: 2.19, 95%CI: 1.48-3.24, I2:86%). On stratification, the strength of association was greater in the case-control studies (pooled OR: 4.01, 95%CI: 1.26-12.72, I2:82%) than other designs (pooled OR:1.77,95%CI:1.18-2.65, I2:87%). Three factors such as \'being male\'(pooled OR:2.06, 95%CI:1.29-2.83), the exposure to livestock animals (pooled OR: 1.95, 95%CI:1.26-2.64), the lacerated wound (pooled OR:4.35, 95%CI:3.07-5.64) were the risk factors significantly associated with the incidence of leptospirosis following flooding in the absence of within-study heterogeneity (I2: 0%). We acknowledge study limitations such as publication bias and type 2 statistical errors. We recommended flood control and other environmental modifications that are expected to reduce the risk of leptospiral infection, and a multi-sectoral effort to this aspect would have long-term benefits.','Naing C and Reid SA and Aye SN and Htet NH and Ambu S','PloS one',NULL,'Animals,*Floods,Humans,Leptospirosis/*epidemiology/microbiology,Livestock/microbiology,Risk Factors,Zoonoses/*epidemiology/microbiology'),(299,2,'32450783','32450783','Methodological Quality of Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses Published in High-Impact Otolaryngology Journals.','OBJECTIVE: To assess the methodological quality of intervention-focused systematic reviews (SRs) and meta-analyses (MAs) published in high-impact otolaryngology journals.

Abstracts were screened to identify published manuscripts in which the authors indicated clearly that they were performing an SR or MA. Applying a modified typology of reviews, 4 reviewers characterized the review type as SR, MA, or another review type. A simplified version of the AMSTAR 2 (A MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews 2) tool was used to assess the reporting and methodological quality of the SRs and MAs that were focused on interventions. RESULTS: Search and abstract screening generated 499 manuscripts that identified themselves as performing an SR or MA.

However, the quality of the development of existing instruments is uncertain. The aim of this systematic review was to assess the development process of patient-reported outcome (PRO) instruments including their initial validation to measure physical activity in chronically ill or elderly patient populations. METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature search of electronic databases (Medline, Embase, Psychinfo, Cinahl) and hand searches. We included studies describing the original development of fully structured instruments measuring dimensions of physical activity or related constructs in chronically ills or elderly. We broadened the population to elderly because they are likely to share physical activity limitations. At least two reviewers independently conducted title and abstract screening and full text assessment. We evaluated instruments in terms of their aim, items identification and selection, domain development, test-retest reliability, internal consistency, validity and responsiveness. RESULTS: Of the 2542 references from the database search and 89 from the hand search, 103 full texts which covered 104 instruments met our inclusion criteria. For almost half of the instruments the authors clearly described the aim of the instruments before the scales were developed. For item identification, patient input was used in 38% of the instruments and in 32% adaptation of existing scales and/or unsystematic literature searches were the only sources for the generation of items. For item reduction, in 56% of the instruments patient input was used and in 33% the item reduction process was not clearly described. Test-retest reliability was assessed for 61%, validity for 85% and responsiveness to change for 19% of the instruments. CONCLUSIONS: Many PRO instruments exist to measure dimensions of physical activity in chronically ill and elderly patient populations, which reflects the relevance of this outcome. However, the development processes often lacked definitions of the instruments\' aims and patient input. If PROs for physical activity were to be used in clinical trials more attention needs to be paid to the establishment of content validity through patient input and to the assessment of their evaluative measurement properties.','Frei A and Williams K and Vetsch A and Dobbels F and Jacobs L and Rudell K and Puhan MA','Health and quality of life outcomes',NULL,'Aged,Aged, 80 and over,*Chronic Disease,Humans,Middle Aged,*Motor Activity,*Quality of Life,Self Report,Surveys and Questionnaires'),(302,2,'28350645','28350645','The Use of Bowel Protocols in Critically Ill Adult Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.','OBJECTIVE: Constipation is common among critically ill patients and has been associated with adverse patient outcomes.

METHODS: Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), CINAHL, and PEDro were searched from January 2005 to June 2015. Supplementary searches included conference abstracts and trials registers (2013-2015). Included studies had patients >/= 18 years with UI or FI, reported treatment cure or success rates, had >/= 50 patients treated with any intervention recognized in international guideline algorithms, a follow-up >/= 3 months, and were published from 2005 onwards. Title and abstract screening, full paper screening, data extraction and risk-of-bias assessment were performed independently by two reviewers. Disagreements were resolved through discussion or referral to a third reviewer where necessary. A narrative summary of included studies is presented. RESULTS: Most evidence was found for UI: Surgical interventions for stress UI showed a median cure rate of 82.3% (interquartile range (IQR), 72-89.5%); people with urgency UI were mostly treated using medications (median cure rate for antimuscarinics = 49%; IQR, 35.6-58%). Pelvic floor muscle training and bulking agents showed lower cure rates for UI. Sacral neuromodulation for FI had a median cure rate of 38.6% (IQR, 35.6-40.6%).

There was a lack of data in the disabled and in those with neurological diseases, in the elderly and those with cognitive impairment. Surgical interventions were effective for stress UI. Other interventions for UI and FI showed lower cure rates. Many individuals are likely to be reliant on containment strategies.

Since its publication, debate has arisen around whether results could be applied to mature trauma systems in developed nations, with global opinion divided. The aim of this study was to determine if, among trauma patients in or at significant risk of major haemorrhages, there is an association of geographic region with the proportion of patients that received tranexamic acid. Materials and Methods: We conducted a systematic review of the literature. Potentially eligible papers were first screened via title and abstract screening. A full copy of the remaining papers was then obtained and screened for final inclusion. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for non-randomised control trials was used for quality assessment of the final studies included. A meta-analysis was conducted using a random-effects model, reporting variation in use sub-grouped by geographical location. Results: There were 727 papers identified through database searching and 23 manuscripts met the criteria for final inclusion in this review. There was a statistically significant variation in the use of TXA for included patients. Europe and Oceania had higher usage rates of TXA compared to other continents. Use of TXA in Asia and Africa was significantly less than other continents and varied use was observed in North America. Conclusions: A large geographical variance in the use of TXA for trauma patients in or at significant risk of major haemorrhage currently exists. The populations in Asia and Africa, where the results of CRASH-2 could be most readily generalised to, reported low rates of use. The reason why remains unclear and further research is required to standardise the use of TXA for trauma resuscitation.','Walsh K and O\'Keeffe F and Mitra B','Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)',NULL,'Antifibrinolytic Agents/*therapeutic use,Drug Utilization/*statistics & numerical data,Emergency Medical Services/methods/*statistics & numerical data,Global Health,Hemorrhage/*prevention & control,Humans,Resuscitation,Tranexamic Acid/*therapeutic use,Wounds and Injuries/*drug therapy'),(308,2,'31514395','31514395','Consumer Understanding, Perception and Interpretation of Serving Size Information on Food Labels: A Scoping Review.','The increase in packaged food and beverage portion sizes has been identified as a potential factor implicated in the rise of the prevalence of obesity. In this context, the objective of this systematic scoping review was to investigate how healthy adults perceive and interpret serving size information on food packages and how this influences product perception and consumption. Such knowledge is needed to improve food labelling understanding and guide consumers toward healthier portion size choices. A search of seven databases (2010 to April 2019) provided the records for title and abstract screening, with relevant articles assessed for eligibility in the full-text. Fourteen articles met the inclusion criteria, with relevant data extracted by one reviewer and checked for consistency by a second reviewer. Twelve studies were conducted in North America, where the government regulates serving size information. Several studies reported a poor understanding of serving size labelling. Indeed, consumers interpreted the labelled serving size as a recommended serving for dietary guidelines for healthy eating rather than a typical consumption unit, which is set by the manufacturer or regulated in some countries such as in the U.S. and Canada. Not all studies assessed consumption; however, larger labelled serving sizes resulted in larger self-selected portion sizes in three studies. However, another study performed on confectionary reported the opposite effect, with larger labelled serving sizes leading to reduced consumption. The limited number of included studies showed that labelled serving size affects portion size selection and consumption, and that any labelled serving size format changes may result in increased portion size selection, energy intake and thus contribute to the rise of the prevalence of overweight and obesity. Research to test cross-continentally labelled serving size format changes within experimental and natural settings (e.g., at home) are needed. In addition, tailored, comprehensive and serving-size-specific food literacy initiatives need to be evaluated to provide recommendations for effective serving size labelling. This is required to ensure the correct understanding of nutritional content, as well as informing food choices and consumption, for both core foods and discretionary foods.','Van der Horst K and Bucher T and Duncanson K and Murawski B and Labbe D','Nutrients',NULL,'Adolescent,Adult,Choice Behavior,*Comprehension,*Consumer Behavior,Energy Intake,Feeding Behavior,Female,*Food Labeling,*Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice,Humans,Male,Middle Aged,Nutritive Value,Obesity/epidemiology/*prevention & control,Prevalence,Recommended Dietary Allowances,Risk Factors,*Serving Size,Young Adult'),(309,2,'27929613','27929613','(no title found)','OBJECTIVES: To determine the safety, efficacy, and evidence for halting disease progression for retinal prosthesis systems (RPSs) and the outcomes that are and could be assessed in future studies of these devices.

REVIEW METHODS: We performed redundant title and abstract screening with one reviewer\'s selection required for full-text article retrieval. Dual independent review was performed on all full-text articles, with disagreements resolved by consensus. Data extraction was performed by a single reviewer and was fully verified by a second reviewer. Extracted data included study design, psychometric properties assessment methods based on the COSMIN checklist, patient blinding to experimental condition, outcome assessor blinding to experimental condition, experimental condition randomly presented, number of outcome assessors, country/site, number of patients enrolled, patient inclusion criteria, patient exclusion criteria, RPS treatment details, prior treatment, concurrent treatment, study duration, diagnosis, age at diagnosis, age at implantation, eye implanted, time from implantation to study participation, sex, race, visual acuity at time of implantation, outcomes, and outcome definitions. We assessed risk of bias of individual studies for the outcomes of interest, and graded the overall strength of evidence using Evidence-based Practice Centers guidance. RESULTS: Eleven studies of RPS effectiveness were included. Although some patients clearly improve on tests of visual function, visual acuity, visual field, color vision, laboratory-based function, and day-to-day function from an RPS, the evidence was insufficient to estimate the proportion of patients who would benefit. Intraoperative adverse events were typically mild but some serious adverse events were reported, including intraocular pressure increase, hypotony, and presumed endophthalmitis. Three studies pointed to the possibility that RPSs may provide neuroprotection. Of the 74 outcomes reported in the 11 included studies, only 4 (Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study visual acuity test [ETDRS], Grating Acuity Test [GAT], Chow Color Test [CCT], and Functional Low-Vision Observer Rated Assessment [FLORA]) had evidence of validity and/or reliability. Measures with evidence of validity and reliability that could be used in future RPS studies include full-field flash test, Grating Contrast Sensitivity (GCS), FAST instrument (Functional Assessment of Self-Reliance on Tasks), Very Low Vision Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL-VLV), Modified National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire 25-item (NEI-VFQ-25) plus supplement, and the Modified Impact of Vision Impairment (IVI). CONCLUSIONS: Some patients clearly benefit from RPSs. Future studies of retinal prosthesis should make an effort to report valid and reliable measures of day-to-day function and quality of life.','Fontanarosa J and Treadwell JR and Samson DJ and VanderBeek BL and Schoelles K','',NULL,''),(310,2,'31658692','31658692','Statistical Approaches in the Studies Assessing Associations between Human Milk Immune Composition and Allergic Diseases: A Scoping Review.','A growing number of studies are focusing on the associations between human milk (HM) immunological composition and allergic diseases.

In recent years, indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence imaging techniques have been applied during surgery to evaluate flap perfusion. However, this investigation has found that there is little consensus regarding the standard dose of ICG as well as the pre-operative requirements of ICG allergy testing. The aim of this study is to summarize the applications of ICG to tissue transfers and safe dosing practices and to provide insight to the possible adverse effects of ICG on flap surgery with the goal of helping clinicians apply ICG safely and efficiently to tissue transfer procedures. METHODS: A literature search was performed using, Wiley InterScience, and Springer with the key words, \'Flap,\' \'indocyanine green,\' \'surgery,\' and related mesh words for all publications between 2005 and 2015. Title and abstract screening was performed using predefined in- and exclusion criteria. RESULTS: Seventy-three articles were included. These were classified as \"application of ICG in flap surgery\" and \"the security of applying ICG in flap surgery\". CONCLUSIONS: ICG fluorescence imaging preoperatively facilitates the detection of perforators in tissue flaps with thickness <20 mm, aids in the evaluation of flap microcirculation and perfusion, and allows surgeons to select dominant cutaneous nerves while evaluating the quality of vascular anastomoses and locating thromboses. The literature also concluded that potential allergic reactions to ICG should be taken into consideration.','Li K and Zhang Z and Nicoli F and D\'Ambrosia C and Xi W and Lazzeri D and Feng S and Su W and Li H and Ciudad P and Tremp M and Zhang YX','Journal of reconstructive microsurgery',NULL,'*Coloring Agents,Fluorescein Angiography/methods,Humans,*Indocyanine Green,Microcirculation/*physiology,Perfusion Imaging/methods,Reconstructive Surgical Procedures/*methods,Surgical Flaps/blood supply/*transplantation'),(312,2,'32092933','32092933','Impact of Dietary Interventions during Pregnancy on Maternal, Neonatal, and Child Outcomes in Low- and Middle-Income Countries.','Optimal nutrition plays a crucial role in pregnancy.

Previous studies have attempted to quantify performance with able-bodied riders using scientific methods; however, definitive measures have yet to be established for the horse and/or the rider. This may be, in part, due to the variety of movements and gaits that are found within a dressage test and also due to the complexity of the horse-rider partnership. The aim of this review is therefore to identify objective measurements of horse performance in dressage and the functional abilities of the rider that may influence them to achieve higher scores. Five databases (SportDiscuss, CINAHL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, VetMed) were systematically searched from 1980 to May 2018. Studies were included if they fulfilled the following criteria: (1) English language; (2) employ objective, quantitative outcome measures for describing equine and human performance in dressage; (3) describe objective measures of superior horse performance using between-subject comparisons and/or relating outcome measures to competitive scoring methods; (4) describe demands of dressage using objective physiological and/or biomechanical measures from human athletes and/or how these demands are translated into superior performance. In total, 773 articles were identified. Title and abstract screening resulted in 155 articles that met the eligibility criteria, 97 were excluded during the full screening of articles, leaving 58 included articles (14 horse, 44 rider) involving 311 equine and 584 able-bodied human participants. Mean +/- sd (%) quality scores were 63.5 +/- 15.3 and 72.7 +/- 14.7 for the equine and human articles respectively. Significant objective measures of horse performance (n = 12 articles) were grouped into themes and separated by gait/movement. A range of temporal variables that indicated superior performance were found in all gaits/movements. For the rider, n = 5 articles reported variables that identified significant differences in skill level, which included the postural position and ROM of the rider\'s pelvis, trunk, knee and head. The timing of rider pelvic and trunk motion in relation to the movement of the horse emerged as an important indicator of rider influence. As temporal variables in the horse are consistently linked to superior performance it could be surmised that better overall dressage performance requires minimal disruption from the rider whilst the horse maintains a specific gait/movement. Achieving the gait/movement in the first place depends upon the intrinsic characteristics of the horse, the level of training achieved and the ability of the rider to apply the correct aid. The information from this model will be used to develop an empirical study to test the relative strength of association between impairment and performance in able-bodied and Para Dressage riders.','Hobbs SJ and St George L and Reed J and Stockley R and Thetford C and Sinclair J and Williams J and Nankervis K and Clayton HM','PeerJ',NULL,''),(315,2,'31397482','31397482','Poor dietary intake of nutrients and food groups are associated with increased risk of periodontal disease among community-dwelling older adults: a systematic literature review.','CONTEXT: Periodontal disease is a chronic inflammatory gum condition that is more prevalent in older populations. The development of periodontal disease has been directly linked to inflammatory dietary habits. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review aimed to 1) describe the relationship and 2) describe the direction of the relationship between dietary intake (nutrients and food groups) and periodontal disease in community-dwelling, older adults. PRISMA guidelines were followed for this review. DATA SOURCES: A systematic search of the databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, Global Health, CINAHL, Science Direct, Informit, and Cochrane Library was conducted from the earliest possible date until September 2018. Search terms were related to main themes: \"periodontal disease,\" \"gingivitis,\" \"gum diseases,\" \"dietary intake\" and \"older adults.\" The search produced 779 records, and after additional publications were obtained and duplicates were removed, 666 publications underwent title and abstract screening. Included papers were written in English and were based on populations of healthy, older adults living in community-based settings. Nine papers met inclusion criteria and were included in this review. DATA EXTRACTION: Sample size, participant characteristics, inclusion and exclusion criteria, periodontal measures, dietary measures, confounders, and results were sorted by study type, author, year, and country. DATA ANALYSIS: Quality of the extracted data was analyzed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system. CONCLUSIONS: Inverse associations were found between fatty acids, vitamin C, vitamin E, beta-carotene, fiber, calcium, dairy, fruits, and vegetables and risk of periodontal disease.

Machine learning tools which semi-automate citation screening might improve efficiency. Few studies have assessed use of screening prioritization functionality or compared two tools head to head. In this project, we compared performance of two machine-learning tools for potential use in citation screening. METHODS: Using 9 evidence reports previously completed by the ECRI Institute Evidence-based Practice Center team, we compared performance of Abstrackr and EPPI-Reviewer, two off-the-shelf citations screening tools, for identifying relevant citations. Screening prioritization functionality was tested for 3 large reports and 6 small reports on a range of clinical topics. Large report topics were imaging for pancreatic cancer, indoor allergen reduction, and inguinal hernia repair. We trained Abstrackr and EPPI-Reviewer and screened all citations in 10% increments. In Task 1, we inputted whether an abstract was ordered for full-text screening; in Task 2, we inputted whether an abstract was included in the final report. For both tasks, screening continued until all studies ordered and included for the actual reports were identified. We assessed potential reductions in hypothetical screening burden (proportion of citations screened to identify all included studies) offered by each tool for all 9 reports. RESULTS: For the 3 large reports, both EPPI-Reviewer and Abstrackr performed well with potential reductions in screening burden of 4 to 49% (Abstrackr) and 9 to 60% (EPPI-Reviewer). Both tools had markedly poorer performance for 1 large report (inguinal hernia), possibly due to its heterogeneous key questions. Based on McNemar\'s test for paired proportions in the 3 large reports, EPPI-Reviewer outperformed Abstrackr for identifying articles ordered for full-text review, but Abstrackr performed better in 2 of 3 reports for identifying articles included in the final report. For small reports, both tools provided benefits but EPPI-Reviewer generally outperformed Abstrackr in both tasks, although these results were often not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Abstrackr and EPPI-Reviewer performed well, but prioritization accuracy varied greatly across reports. Our work suggests screening prioritization functionality is a promising modality offering efficiency gains without giving up human involvement in the screening process.','Tsou AY and Treadwell JR and Erinoff E and Schoelles K','Systematic reviews',NULL,''),(317,2,'24831570','24831570','Are the spatio-temporal parameters of gait capable of distinguishing a faller from a non-faller elderly?','Fall is a common and a major cause of injuries. It is important to find elderlies who are prone to falls. The majority of serious falls occur during walking among the older adults. Analyzing the spatio-temporal parameters of walking is an easy way of assessment in the clinical setting, but is it capable of distinguishing a faller from a non-faller elderly? Through a systematic review of the literature, the objective of this systematic review was to identify and summarize the differences in the spatio-temporal parameters of walking in elderly fallers and non-fallers and to find out if these parameters are capable of distinguishing a faller from a non-faller. All original research articles which compared any special or temporal walking parameters in faller and non-faller elderlies were systematically searched within the Scopus and Embase databases. Effect size analysis was also done to standardize findings and compare the gait parameters of fallers and non-fallers across the selected studies. The electronic search led to 5381 articles. After title and abstract screening 30 articles were chosen; further assessment of the full texts led to 17 eligible articles for inclusion in the review. It seems that temporal measurements are more sensitive to the detection of risk of fall in elderly people. The results of the 17 selected studies showed that fallers have a tendency toward a slower walking speed and cadence, longer stride time, and double support duration. Also, fallers showed shorter stride and step length, wider step width and more variability in spatio-temporal parameters of gait. According to the effect size analysis, step length, gait speed, stride length and stance time variability were respectively more capable of differentiating faller from non-faller elderlies. However, because of the difference of methodology and number of studies which investigated each parameter, these results are prone to imprecision. Spatio-temporal analysis of level walking is not sufficient and cannot act as a reliable predictor of falls in elderly individuals.','Mortaza N and Abu Osman NA and Mehdikhani N','European journal of physical and rehabilitation medicine',NULL,'Accidental Falls/economics/prevention & control/*statistics & numerical data,Aged,Aged, 80 and over,Databases, Bibliographic,Female,Gait/*physiology,Humans,Male,Middle Aged,Postural Balance/*physiology,Risk Assessment/methods,Spatio-Temporal Analysis,Walking/*physiology'),(318,2,'21035849','21035849','Chronic intervillositis of the placenta: a systematic review.','OBJECTIVE: Chronic intervillositis of the placenta is known to be associated with poor reproductive outcome and a high risk of recurrence.

METHODS: All Vascular Annual Meeting abstracts for 2012 to 2016 were obtained through the Journal of Vascular Surgery. Two reviewers independently screened abstracts for eligibility. Research with a nonclinical focus was excluded from the study. Data extracted from eligible abstracts included study type (therapeutic, prognostic, diagnostic), study size, country of academic institution of primary author, presentation type, and whether the sample was recruited or from a database. Abstracts were assigned an LOE using the 2011 Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine classification scheme based on study design (eg, case series, randomized controlled trial). A chi(2) test and analysis of variance test were conducted to assess nonrandom changes in LOE during the study period. RESULTS: Of the 1403 abstracts screened, 1147 were included. Inter-rater agreement was high (kappa value for abstract screening was 0.93; kappa value for data extraction was 0.89). Therapeutic studies were the most common study type (58%), followed by prognostic studies (37%), then diagnostic studies (5%). The majority of abstracts (75.0%) were submitted from North American institutions. Overall, 0.35% of the presentations were level I evidence, 3.1% level II, 52.8% level III, 38.0% level IV, and 5.7% level V. The average LOE per year fluctuated between 3.54 and 3.32, with a mean LOE of 3.45. The proportion of high-quality evidence (level I and level II) increased in the years 2015 and 2016, representing 78% of all level I and level II abstracts presented in the 5-year period. A chi(2) test between LOE and year yielded a P value of .0084, indicating significant nonrandom change in LOE between 2012 and 2016. The majority of high LOE research was presented in poster sessions (37.5%), plenary sessions (27.5%), and international forum sessions/talks (25%) at the meeting. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, average LOE remained relatively consistent between 2012 and 2016, with most abstracts classified as level III or level IV. There was a gradual, albeit minor, increase in the proportion of level I and level II evidence in 2015 and 2016, potentially indicating the increasing commitment to producing and disseminating high-level research in vascular surgery.

Overall, single-reviewer abstract screening missed 13% of relevant studies (sensitivity: 86.6%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 80.6%-91.2%). By comparison, dual-reviewer abstract screening missed 3% of relevant studies (sensitivity: 97.5%; 95% CI, 95.1%-98.8%). The corresponding specificities were 79.2% (95% CI, 77.4%-80.9%) and 68.7% (95% CI, 66.4%-71.0%), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Single-reviewer abstract screening does not appear to fulfill the high methodological standards that decisionmakers expect from systematic reviews. It may be a viable option for rapid reviews, which deliberately lower methodological standards to provide decision makers with accelerated evidence synthesis products.','Gartlehner G and Affengruber L and Titscher V and Noel-Storr A and Dooley G and Ballarini N and Konig F','Journal of clinical epidemiology',NULL,''),(323,2,'32813413','32813413','Effects of reading media on reading comprehension in health professional education: a systematic review protocol.','OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of digital-based reading versus paper-based reading on reading comprehension among students, trainees, and residents participating in health professional education. INTRODUCTION: Several reviews have examined the effects of reading media on reading comprehension; however, none have considered health professional education specifically. The growing use of electronic media in health professional education, as well as recent data on the consequences of digital-based reading on learning, justify the necessity to review the current literature to provide research and educational recommendations. INCLUSION CRITERIA: Studies conducted with health professions students, trainees, and residents individually receiving educational material written in their first language in a paper-based or a digital-based format will be considered. Studies conducted among participants with cognitive impairment or reading difficulties will be excluded. Observational, experimental and quasi-experimental studies that assess reading comprehension measured by previously validated or researcher-generated tests will be considered. METHODS: Relevant studies will be sought from CINAHL, Embase, ERIC, Google Scholar, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Web of Science (SCI and SSCI), without date or language restrictions. Two independent reviewers will perform title and abstract screening, full-text review, critical appraisal, and data extraction.

A systematic literature review.','AIM: The aim of this systematic review was to screen the literature in order to locate animal and clinical data on bone-implant contact (BIC) and clinical survival/success that would help to answer the question \'Are ceramic implants a viable alternative to titanium implants?\' MATERIAL AND METHODS: A literature search was performed in the following databases: (1) the Cochrane Oral Health Group\'s Trials Register, (2) the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), (3) MEDLINE (Ovid), and (4) PubMed. To evaluate biocompatibility, animal investigations were scrutinized regarding the amount of BIC and to assess implant longevity clinical data were evaluated. RESULTS: The PubMed search yielded 349 titles and the Cochrane/MEDLINE search yielded 881 titles. Based upon abstract screening and discarding duplicates from both searches, 100 full-text articles were obtained and subjected to additional evaluation. A further publication was included based on the manual search. The selection process resulted in the final sample of 25 studies. No (randomized) controlled clinical trials regarding the outcome of zirconia and alumina ceramic implants could be found. The systematic review identified histological animal studies showing similar BIC between alumina, zirconia and titanium. Clinical investigations using different alumina oral implants up to 10 years showed survival/success rates in the range of 23 to 98% for different indications. The included zirconia implant studies presented a survival rate from 84% after 21 months to 98% after 1 year. CONCLUSIONS: No difference was found in the rate of osseointegration between the different implant materials in animal experiments. Only cohort investigations were located with questionable scientific value. Alumina implants did not perform satisfactorily and therefore, based on this review, are not a viable alternative to titanium implants. Currently, the scientific clinical data for ceramic implants in general and for zirconia implants in particular are not sufficient to recommend ceramic implants for routine clinical use. Zirconia, however, may have the potential to be a successful implant material, although this is as yet unsupported by clinical investigations.','Andreiotelli M and Wenz HJ and Kohal RJ','Clinical oral implants research',NULL,'Aluminum Oxide,Animals,Dental Implantation, Endosseous,*Dental Implants,*Dental Porcelain,*Dental Restoration Failure,Humans,Osseointegration,*Titanium,Zirconium'),(325,2,'22554554','22554554','Learning concepts of cinenurducation: an integrative review.','BACKGROUND: Cinenurducation is the use of films in both didactic and clinical nursing education. Although films are already used as instructional aids in nursing education, few studies have been made that demonstrate the learning concepts that can be attributed to this particular teaching strategy.

METHOD: The databases CINAHL, MEDLINE, PsychINFO, ERIC, EBSCO, ProQuest Library Journal, and Scopus databases were searched for articles. Fifteen peer-reviewed articles were selected through title and abstract screening from \"films in nursing\" related articles found in internationally published articles in English from the past 20 years. RESULT: Four common concepts emerged that relate to cinenurducation: (a) student-centered, (b) experiential, (c) reflective, and (d) problem-solving learning. Current literature corroborates cinenurducation as an effective teaching strategy with its learning activities in nursing education.

A systematic review and meta-analysis of 12 cohort studies.','Ovarian cancer (OC) is the sixth most common cancer among women, and its prognosis is not favorable. Diabetes mellitus (DM) is hypothesized to be associated with a higher mortality in ovarian cancer patients, but evidence is inconsistent. Thus, we aim to investigate if DM is associated with the long-term all-cause and long-term cancer-specific mortality in ovarian cancer patients by synthesizing available epidemiologic evidences. We used 4 electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Scopus) to search for eligible articles. Title/abstract screening, full-text review, data extraction, and quality assessment were performed by reviewers independently. In meta-analysis, studies reporting risk ratio (RR) or hazard ratio that investigated the association between DM and mortality of OC patients were synthesized by a random-effect model. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were performed by certain stratification or restrictive rules. Publication bias was assessed by funnel plots and Egger test. Statistical heterogeneity was evaluated by the I-squared value and a chi-squared test for the Cochrane Q statistic. Twelve cohort studies involving 14 outcome measures were included. In overall meta-analysis, the synthesized RR for all-cause mortality was 1.44 (95% CI 1.16-1.79) without substantial statistical heterogeneity (PCochrane = .145, I(2) = 34.1%); the synthesized RR for cancer-specific mortality was 1.44 (95% CI 1.08-1.93) with substantial heterogeneity (PCochrane < .001, I(2) = 90.1%).

This study demonstrates the use of an economic evaluation framework to compare the costs and effects of four variant approaches to identifying eligible studies for consideration in systematic reviews. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted using a basic decision-analytic model, to compare the relative efficiency of \'safety first\', \'double screening\', \'single screening\' and \'single screening with text mining\' approaches in the title-abstract screening stage of a \'case study\' systematic review about undergraduate medical education in UK general practice settings. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated as the \'incremental cost per citation \'saved\' from inappropriate exclusion\' from the review. Resource use and effect parameters were estimated based on retrospective analysis of \'review process\' meta-data curated alongside the \'case study\' review, in conjunction with retrospective simulation studies to model the integrated use of text mining. Unit cost parameters were estimated based on the \'case study\' review\'s project budget. A base case analysis was conducted, with deterministic sensitivity analyses to investigate the impact of variations in values of key parameters. RESULTS: Use of \'single screening with text mining\' would have resulted in title-abstract screening workload reductions (base case analysis) of >60 % compared with other approaches. Across modelled scenarios, the \'safety first\' approach was, consistently, equally effective and less costly than conventional \'double screening\'. Compared with \'single screening with text mining\', estimated ICERs for the two non-dominated approaches (base case analyses) ranged from pound1975 (\'single screening\' without a \'provisionally included\' code) to pound4427 (\'safety first\' with a \'provisionally included\' code) per citation \'saved\'. Patterns of results were consistent between base case and sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Alternatives to the conventional \'double screening\' approach, integrating text mining, warrant further consideration as potentially more efficient approaches to identifying eligible studies for systematic reviews. Comparable economic evaluations conducted using other systematic review datasets are needed to determine the generalisability of these findings and to build an evidence base to inform guidance for review authors.','Shemilt I and Khan N and Park S and Thomas J','Systematic reviews',NULL,'*Cost-Benefit Analysis,Data Mining/*methods,Humans,Patient Safety,*Research Design'),(330,2,'24549387','24549387','Comparison of unilateral versus bilateral pedicle screw fixation in degenerative lumbar diseases: a meta-analysis.','PURPOSE: Traditionally, lumbar spinal surgery is performed with bilateral pedicle screw fixation to provide stability as the fusion heals. However, many studies have reported that unilateral pedicle screw fixation is as effective as bilateral constructs. To compare the clinical outcomes, complications, and surgical trauma between the two techniques for treatment of degenerative lumbar diseases, we conducted a meta-analysis. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, Google Scholar, and Cochrane databases for relevant controlled studies up to August 2013 that compared unilateral with bilateral fixation for the treatment of degenerative lumbar diseases. We independently performed title/abstract screening and full-text screening. A random effects model was used for heterogeneous data; otherwise, a fixed effect model was used, pooling data using mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes and odds ratio (OR) for dichotomous outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 12 articles (865 participants) were eligible. Overall, there were significant differences between the two groups for blood loss (MD = -171.73, 95 % CI = -281.70 to -61.76; p = 0.002), operation time (MD = -66.02, 95 % CI = -115.52 to -16.51; p = 0.009), and fusion rate (OR = 0.50, 95 % CI = 0.26-0.96; p = 0.004). However, there were no significant differences in hospital stay (MD = -4.44, 95 % CI = -13.37 to 4.50), ODI (MD = -0.09, 95 % CI = -0.59 to 0.42; p = 0.74), JOA (MD = 0.18, 95 % CI = -0.77 to 1.14; p = 0.71), VAS (MD = -0.04, 95 % CI = -0.16 to 0.08; p = 0.49), SF-36 (PF: MD = -1.11, 95 % CI = -4.38 to 2.17, p = 0.51; GH: MD = 1.22, 95 % CI = -2.17 to 4.60, p = 0.48; MH: MD = -0.22, 95 % CI = -3.83 to 3.38, p = 0.90) and complications (OR = 1.15, 95 % CI = 0.72-1.85; p = 0.56).

This has been triggered by an increasing availability of spatially indexed data, enabling not only the characterisation of malaria at macrospatial and microspatial levels but also the development of geospatial techniques and tools that enable health policy planners to use these available data more effectively. However, there has been little synthesis regarding the variety of spatio - temporal approaches employed, covariates employed and \'best practice\' type recommendations to guide future modelling decisions.

It is known that patient and caregiver-targeted educational interventions addressing the proper use of pain management may provide significant clinical value. This review examines the literature surrounding the use of multimedia interventions for patient and caregiver education (PCE) on pain management compared to traditional educational interventions. A literature search was conducted in Ovid MEDLINE (1946-July Week 2, 2016), Ovid Embase (1947-2016 Week 29), and Ovid Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (up to June 2016). Paired reviewers conducted title and abstract screening and full-text screening to identify experimental, quasi-experimental and cohort studies evaluating one or more multimedia-based PCE interventions focused on cancer pain and pain management and targeting patients and/or caregivers. Findings were extracted by paired reviewers and synthesized qualitatively. Of the 68 full-text papers assessed, 7 were deemed relevant, of which 5 were RCTs and 2 were observational studies. We found limited but convincing quantitative data to suggest that the use of multimedia use in pain management education for patients/caregivers has greater value-added benefit compared to standard education. While there is evidence suggesting a positive effect on pain-related outcomes with the use of multimedia-based patient and caregiver-targeted interventions, it is limited to a small number of lower-quality studies.

Without complete reporting of the outcomes studied, evidence-based clinical and policy decisions are limited and researchers cannot synthesise, replicate or build on existing research findings. To facilitate harmonised reporting of outcomes in published trial protocols and reports, the Instrument for reporting Planned Endpoints in Clinical Trials (InsPECT) is under development. As one of the initial steps in the development of InsPECT, a scoping review will identify and synthesise existing guidance on the reporting of trial outcomes. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will apply methods based on the Joanna Briggs Institute scoping review methods manual. Documents that provide explicit guidance on trial outcome reporting will be searched for using: (1) an electronic bibliographic database search; (2) a grey literature search; and (3) solicitation of colleagues for guidance documents using a snowballing approach. Reference list screening will be performed for included documents. Search results will be divided between two trained reviewers who will complete title and abstract screening, full-text screening and data charting. Captured trial outcome reporting guidance will be compared with candidate InsPECT items to support, refute or refine InsPECT content and to assess the need for the development of additional items. Data analysis will explore common features of guidance and use quantitative measures (eg, frequencies) to characterise guidance and its sources. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: A paper describing the review findings will be published in a peer-reviewed journal. The results will be used to inform the InsPECT development process, helping to ensure that InsPECT provides an evidence-based tool for standardising trial outcome reporting.','Butcher NJ and Mew EJ and Saeed L and Monsour A and Chee-A-Tow A and Chan AW and Moher D and Offringa M','BMJ open',NULL,'Clinical Trials as Topic/methods/*standards,Consensus,Consensus Development Conferences as Topic,Endpoint Determination/*standards,Humans,*Information Dissemination,Research Design/*standards,Review Literature as Topic,Treatment Outcome'),(335,2,'32239206','32239206','Adherence to and Retention in Medications for Opioid Use Disorder among Adolescents and Young Adults.','The volatile opioid epidemic is associated with higher levels of opioid use disorder (OUD) and negative health outcomes in adolescents and young adults. Medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) demonstrate the best evidence for treating OUD. Adherence to and retention in MOUD among adolescents and young adults, however, is incompletely understood. This systematic review examines the state of the literature regarding the association of age with adherence to and retention in MOUD using methadone, buprenorphine, or naltrexone among persons aged 10 to 24 along with related facilitators and barriers. The research team searched for all studies of MOUD that examined adherence, retention, or related concepts as an outcome variable where the sample included adolescents or young adults. Search criteria generated 10,229 records, which, after removing duplicates and conducting title/abstract screening, yielded 587 studies for full-text review. Ultimately, 52 articles met inclusion criteria for abstraction and 17 were selected for qualitative coding and analysis. This review found younger age to be consistently associated with shorter retention in the published literature, although the overall quality of included studies was low. Several factors at the individual, interpersonal, and institutional levels, such as concurrent substance use, MOUD adherence, family conflict, and MOUD dosage and flexibility, were seen as playing a role in MOUD retention among adolescents and young adults. This review highlights how MOUD providers can tailor treatment to increase retention of adolescents and young adults while pointing to the need for more research explaining MOUD adherence and retention disparities in this age group.','Viera A and Bromberg DJ and Whittaker S and Refsland BM and Stanojlovic M and Nyhan K and Altice FL','Epidemiologic reviews',NULL,''),(336,2,'26273096','26273096','Safe staffing for nursing in emergency departments: evidence review.','OBJECTIVE: Getting staffing levels wrong in hospitals is linked to excess mortality and poor patient experiences but establishing the safe nurse staffing levels in the emergency department (ED) is challenging because patient demand is so variable. This paper reports a review conducted for the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) which sought to identify the research evidence to inform UK nursing workforce planning. DESIGN: We searched 10 electronic databases and relevant websites for English language studies published from 1994. Studies included reported a direct measure of nurse staffing relative to an activity measure (eg, attendances, patient throughput) or an estimate of nurse staffing requirements. Randomised or non-randomised trials, prospective or retrospective observational, cross-sectional or correlational studies, interrupted time-series, and controlled before and after studies were considered. RESULTS: We identified 16,132 items via databases and 2193 items through manual and other searching.

CONCLUSIONS: The evidence is weak but indicates that levels of nurse staffing in the ED are associated with patients leaving without being seen, ED care time and patient satisfaction. Lower staffing is associated with worse outcomes. There remain significant gaps and in particular a lack of evidence on the impact of staffing on direct patient outcomes and adequate economic analyses to inform decisions about nurse staffing. Given that an association between nurse staffing levels and patient outcomes on inpatient wards has been demonstrated, this gap in the evidence about nurse staffing in EDs needs to be addressed.','Recio-Saucedo A and Pope C and Dall\'Ora C and Griffiths P and Jones J and Crouch R and Drennan J','Emergency medicine journal : EMJ',NULL,'Aged,Clinical Competence,Cross-Sectional Studies,*Emergency Service, Hospital,Female,Humans,Nursing Staff, Hospital/*supply & distribution,*Personnel Staffing and Scheduling,Prospective Studies,Retrospective Studies'),(337,2,'28265307','28265307','Antibiotic prophylaxis for prevention of urinary tract infections in prenatal hydronephrosis: An updated systematic review.','INTRODUCTION: While continuous antibiotic prophylaxis (CAP) is currently recommended to prevent urinary tract infections (UTIs) in infants with prenatal hydronephrosis (HN), this recommendation is not evidence-based.

Postoperative emergence delirium develops in 12% to 18% of all children undergoing general anesthesia for surgery. This post-anesthetic phenomenon changes cognitive and psychomotor behavior, and puts pediatric patients and health care personnel at risk of injury. A newer drug, dexmedetomidine, is a selective alpha-2 agonist, which works in the brain and spinal cord that has sedative, analgesic and anxiolytic properties. Dexmedetomidine also has the ability to lower the overall anesthetic requirements by reducing sympathetic outflow in response to painful surgical stimulation. In current literature, there is not a systematic review that compares the effectiveness of preoperative intranasal dexmedetomidine administration against oral midazolam for the prevention of emergence delirium. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this review was to identify the effectiveness of preoperative intranasal dexmedetomidine compared to oral midazolam for the prevention of emergence delirium in the pediatric patient undergoing general anesthesia. INCLUSION CRITERIA TYPES OF PARTICIPANTS: This review considered studies that included pediatric patients aged three to seven years, with an American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification of I or II, and undergoing general anesthesia for elective/ambulatory surgery. This review excluded studies that included patients who had special needs including: developmental delay, chronic pain issues, and/or any preexisting mental or physical health disorders which categorized them above an ASA II. TYPES OF INTERVENTION(S)/PHENOMENA OF INTEREST: This review considered studies that compared preoperative intranasal administration of dexmedetomidine with preoperative oral administration of midazolam for the prevention of emergence delirium. TYPES OF STUDIES: This review considered both experimental and non-experimental study designs including randomized-controlled trials (RCTs), non-randomized control trials, quasi-experimental, before and after studies, prospective and retrospective cohort studies, case control studies, and analytical cross-sectional studies for inclusion. OUTCOMES: This review considered studies that included the presence of postoperative emergence delirium. Only studies that used the Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium Scale to quantify the degree of emergence delirium were included in the review. Adverse events other than emergence delirium were not considered as part of the outcomes inclusion criteria but were to be included in the discussion if any articles were identified. SEARCH STRATEGY: The search strategy aimed to discover both published as well as unpublished studies. A three-step search strategy was utilized in eight databases. Studies published in English or with an English translation after 1999 were considered for inclusion in this review. METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY: Assessment of methodological quality was not conducted as no studies were identified which met the inclusion criteria. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Data extraction and synthesis was not performed since no studies were included in this systematic review. RESULTS: Following the three-step search strategy as previously described, 117 articles were identified: six in Clinical Trials, one in ProQuest, 14 in Ovid MEDLINE, 10 in CINAHL, 16 in the Cochrane Library, 13 in Scopus, 36 in Embase, and 21 in Web of Science. There were 43 duplicates which were identified and removed in Refworks by the primary reviewer. The primary and secondary reviewers independently retrieved 10 potentially relevant studies (from the initial 74) through title and abstract screening as described in the inclusion criteria. All of the retrieved studies were excluded, after assessment of full text, with reasons based on the inclusion criteria. CONCLUSIONS: There is no scientific evidence identifying the effectiveness of preoperative intranasal dexmedetomidine, compared with oral midazolam, for the prevention of emergence delirium in the pediatric patient population.','FitzSimons J and Bonanno LS and Pierce S and Badeaux J','JBI database of systematic reviews and implementation reports',NULL,'Administration, Intranasal,Adrenergic alpha-2 Receptor Agonists/administration & dosage/*pharmacology,Anesthesia, General/*adverse effects,Child,Child, Preschool,Cross-Sectional Studies,Dexmedetomidine/administration & dosage/*pharmacology,Elective Surgical Procedures/methods,Emergence Delirium/epidemiology/*prevention & control/psychology,Humans,Hypnotics and Sedatives,Midazolam/administration & dosage/*pharmacology,Postoperative Complications/psychology,Preoperative Care/*methods,Prospective Studies,Retrospective Studies'),(339,2,'22175257','22175257','A survey of smoking status and cancer risk perceptions among participants attending a hospital-based head and neck screening program.','Abstract Screening for head and neck cancer is underutilized.

However, it is still unclear how SEP during the life course influences periodontal outcomes in adulthood. This study aimed to systematically review longitudinal studies investigating the influence of individual-level SEP during the life course on subsequent periodontitis in adulthood. Inclusion criteria were epidemiological longitudinal observational studies, in which indicators of relative SEP were assessed prior to clinical assessment of periodontitis. Six electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Scopus, Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS) and ScieLO) were searched. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale (NOS). The search identified 1720 papers. After removal of duplicates (n=697), title and abstract screening (n=996), and full-text review (n=19), eight original manuscripts from seven studies were finally included. Sample sizes ranged from 167 to 2806, and the follow-up time from exposure to outcome ranged from 2 to 28 years. Studies evaluated education, occupation or income as SEP indicators. Prevalence, extent and severity of periodontal attachment loss, probing pocket depth and alveolar bone loss were the studied outcomes. Based on NOS, studies presented low risk of bias. Six of eight papers reported that relatively low SEP earlier in life was associated with poorer periodontal health in adulthood. The available scientific evidence demonstrates potential longitudinal impact of earlier lower SEP on later periodontal health. The findings were consistent despite differences in study methods.','Schuch HS and Peres KG and Singh A and Peres MA and Do LG','Community dentistry and oral epidemiology',NULL,'Adult,Chronic Periodontitis/economics/*epidemiology,Humans,Risk Factors,Socioeconomic Factors'),(341,2,'25016240','25016240','Application of diffusion tensor imaging and tractography of the optic radiation in anterior temporal lobe resection for epilepsy: a systematic review.','BACKGROUND: Approximately 50-100% of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy undergoing anterior temporal lobe resection (ATLR) will suffer a postoperative visual field defect (VFD) due to disruption of the optic radiation (OpR). OBJECTIVE: We conducted a systematic review of the literature to examine the role of DTI and tractography in ATLR and its potential in reducing the incidence of postoperative VFD. METHODS: We conducted an electronic literature search using PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and BMJ case report databases. Eligibility for study inclusion was determined on abstract screening using the following criteria: the study must have been (1) an original investigation or case report in humans; (2) investigating the OpR with DTI in cases of ATLR in temporal lobe epilepsy; (3) investigating postoperative VFD. All forms of ATLR and ways of assessing VFD were included to reflect clinical practice. RESULTS: 13 studies (four case reports, eight prospective observational studies, one prospective comparative trial) were included in the review, 179 (mean+/-SD, 13.8+/-12.6; range, 1-48) subjects were investigated using DTI. The time of postoperative VFD measurement differed between the detected studies, ranging from two weeks to nine years following ATLR. A modest number of studies and insufficient statistical homogeneity precluded meta-analysis. However, DTI methods were consistently accurate at quantifying and predicting postoperative damage to the OpR. These methods revealed a correlation between the extent of OpR damage and the severity of postoperative VFD. The first and only trial with 15 subjects compared to 23 controls reported that using intraoperative tractography in ATLR significantly reduces the occurrence of postoperative VFD on comparison to conventional surgical planning. CONCLUSIONS: DTI shows potential to be an effective method used in planning ATLR. Findings from a single modest sized study suggest that tractography may be employed as part of intraoperative navigation techniques in order to avoid injury to the OpR. Further research needs to be conducted to ensure the applicability and effectiveness of this technology before implementation in routine clinical practice.','Piper RJ and Yoong MM and Kandasamy J and Chin RF','Clinical neurology and neurosurgery',NULL,'Anterior Temporal Lobectomy/*adverse effects,Diffusion Tensor Imaging/*methods,Epilepsy, Temporal Lobe/*surgery,Geniculate Bodies/*injuries,Humans,Postoperative Complications/*diagnosis/etiology,Vision Disorders/*diagnosis/etiology'),(342,2,'31895214','31895214','Barriers and facilitators to physical activity participation in adults living with type 1 diabetes: a scoping review protocol.','OBJECTIVE: The objective of this scoping review is to identify and map barriers to and facilitators of physical activity in adults living with type 1 diabetes (T1D). INTRODUCTION: Physical activity is crucial to the day-to-day management of T1D and in the prevention of diabetes-related complications. Despite these benefits, people living with T1D have higher inactivity rates than those in the general population. Identifying barriers and facilitators to physical activity, specific to the T1D population, may help explain this discrepancy. INCLUSION CRITERIA: This scoping review will include articles describing adults aged 18 years or over, living with T1D in any care setting. Included literature will focus on the key concepts under review: barriers to or facilitators of physical activity participation. Literature examining efficacy of strategies to manage blood glucose levels for physical activity will not be included.

This is mainly due to the toll required of a small group of experts to screen and extract potentially eligible citations. Automated approaches have failed so far in providing an accessible and adaptable tool to the research community. Over the past decade, crowdsourcing has become attractive in the scientific field, and implementing it in citation screening could save the investigative team significant work and decrease the time to publication. METHODS: Citations from the 2015 update of a pediatrics vitamin D systematic review were uploaded to an online platform designed for crowdsourcing the screening process (http://www.CHEORI.org/en/CrowdScreenOverview). Three sets of exclusion criteria were used for screening, with a review of abstracts at level one, and full-text eligibility determined through two screening stages. Two trained reviewers, who participated in the initial systematic review, established citation eligibility. In parallel, each citation received four independent assessments from an untrained crowd with a medical background. Citations were retained or excluded if they received three congruent assessments. Otherwise, they were reviewed by the principal investigator. Measured outcomes included sensitivity of the crowd to retain eligible studies, and potential work saved defined as citations sorted by the crowd (excluded or retained) without involvement of the principal investigator. RESULTS: A total of 148 citations for screening were identified, of which 20 met eligibility criteria (true positives). The four reviewers from the crowd agreed completely on 63% (95% CI: 57-69%) of assessments, and achieved a sensitivity of 100% (95% CI: 88-100%) and a specificity of 99% (95% CI: 96-100%). Potential work saved to the research team was 84% (95% CI: 77-89%) at the abstract screening stage, and 73% (95% CI: 67-79%) through all three levels. In addition, different thresholds for citation retention and exclusion were assessed. With an algorithm favoring sensitivity (citation excluded only if all four reviewers agree), sensitivity was maintained at 100%, with a decrease of potential work saved to 66% (95% CI: 59-71%). In contrast, increasing the threshold required for retention (exclude all citations not obtaining 3/4 retain assessments) decreased sensitivity to 85% (95% CI: 65-96%), while improving potential workload saved to 92% (95% CI: 88-95%). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the accuracy of crowdsourcing for systematic review citations screening, with retention of all eligible articles and a significant reduction in the work required from the investigative team. Together, these two findings suggest that crowdsourcing could represent a significant advancement in the area of systematic review. Future directions include further study to assess validity across medical fields and determination of the capacity of a non-medical crowd.','Nama N and Iliriani K and Xia MY and Chen BP and Zhou LL and Pojsupap S and Kappel C and O\'Hearn K and Sampson M and Menon K and McNally JD','Translational pediatrics',NULL,''),(344,2,'32843194','32843194','[SCRUTATIOm: how to detect retracted literature included in systematics reviews and metaanalysis using SCOPUS(c) and ZOTERO(c)].','A good and accurate literature review is a key element of systematic reviews and meta-analyses and always needs to be based on high quality original studies and logically never retracted.

Digital health interventions facilitating interactions between a caregiver and a patient from a distance are a promising approach to improve patient adherence to lifestyle changes proposed by secondary prevention guidelines. Many of these interventions are not implemented in daily practice, even though efficacy has been shown. One of the reasons can be the lack of clear economic incentives for implementation. We propose to map all health economic evidence regarding digital health interventions for secondary stroke prevention. SUMMARY: We performed a systematic search according to PRISMA-P guidelines and searched on PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane, and National Institute for Health Research Economic Evaluation Database. Only digital health interventions for secondary prevention in stroke patients were included and all study designs and health economic outcomes were accepted. We combined the terms \"Stroke OR Cardiovascular,\" \"Secondary prevention,\" \"Digital health interventions,\" and \"Cost\" in one search string using the AND operator. The search performed on April 20, 2017 yielded 163 records of which 26 duplicates were removed. After abstract screening, 20 articles were retained for full-text analysis, of which none reported any health economic evidence that could be included for analysis or discussion. Key Messages: There is a lack of evidence on health economic outcomes on digital health interventions for secondary stroke prevention. Future research in this area should take health economics into consideration when designing a trial and there is a clear need for health economic evidence and models.','Valenzuela Espinoza A and Steurbaut S and Dupont A and Cornu P and van Hooff RJ and Brouns R and Putman K','Cerebrovascular diseases extra',NULL,'Cost-Benefit Analysis,*Health Care Costs,Humans,Recurrence,Secondary Prevention/*economics,Stroke/diagnosis/*economics/*prevention & control,Telemedicine/*economics,Time Factors,Treatment Outcome'),(346,2,'18974831','18974831','Defrosting the digital library: bibliographic tools for the next generation web.','Many scientists now manage the bulk of their bibliographic information electronically, thereby organizing their publications and citation material from digital libraries.

Patient empowerment has been defined as feeling in control of or having mastery in relation to cancer and cancer care. This calls for properly developed questionnaires assessing empowerment from the user perspective. The aim of this review was to identify questionnaires and subscales measuring empowerment and manifestations of empowerment among cancer patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a systematic search of the PubMed, PsycINFO and CINAHL databases. Empowerment and multiple search terms associated with empowerment were included. We included peer-reviewed articles published in English, which described questionnaires measuring empowerment or manifestations of empowerment in a cancer setting. In addition, the questionnaire had to be a patient-reported outcome measure for adult cancer patients. RESULTS: Database searches identified 831 records. Title and abstract screening resulted in 482 records being excluded. The remaining 349 full text articles were retrieved and assessed for eligibility. This led to the inclusion of 33 individual instruments measuring empowerment and manifestations of empowerment. Of these, only four were specifically developed to measure empowerment, and two were originally developed for the cancer setting, whereas the remaining two were developed elsewhere, but adapted to the cancer setting. The other 29 questionnaires were not intended to measure the concept of empowerment, but focused on patient-centered care, patient competence, self-efficacy, etc. However, they were included because part of the instrument (at least five items) was considered to measure empowerment or manifestations of empowerment. CONCLUSION: Our study provides an overview of the available questionnaires, which can be used by researchers and practitioners who wish to measure the concept of empowerment among cancer patients. Very few questionnaires were explicitly developed to explore empowerment, and the review brings to light a significant lack of questionnaires that measure patient empowerment comprehensively.','Eskildsen NB and Joergensen CR and Thomsen TG and Ross L and Dietz SM and Groenvold M and Johnsen AT','Acta oncologica (Stockholm, Sweden)',NULL,'Humans,Neoplasms/*psychology,*Patient Participation,Patient-Centered Care,*Power, Psychological,Psychometrics,*Surveys and Questionnaires'),(348,2,'30081879','30081879','Recommendations for the screening of paediatric latent tuberculosis infection in indigenous communities: a systematic review of screening strategies among high-risk groups in low-incidence countries.','BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) continues to be a global public health concern. Due to the presence of multiple risk factors such as poor housing conditions and food insecurity in Canadian Indigenous communities, this population is at particularly high risk of TB infection. Given the challenges of screening for latent TB infection (LTBI) in remote communities, a synthesis of the existing literature regarding current screening strategies among high-risk groups in low-incidence countries is warranted, in order to provide an evidence base for the optimization of paediatric LTBI screening practices in the Canadian Indigenous context. METHODS: A literature search of the Embase and Medline databases was conducted, and studies pertaining the evaluation of screening strategies or screening tools for LTBI in paediatric high-risk groups in low-incidence countries were included. Studies focusing on LTBI screening in Indigenous communities were also included, regardless of whether they focused on a paediatric population. Their results were summarized and discussed in the context of their relevance to screening strategies suitable to the Canadian Indigenous setting. Grey literature sources such as government reports or policy briefs were also consulted. RESULTS: The initial literature search returned 327 studies, with 266 being excluded after abstract screening, and 36 studies being included in the final review (original research studies: n = 25, review papers or policy recommendations: n = 11). In the examined studies, case identification and cost-effectiveness of universal screening were low in low-incidence countries. Therefore, studies generally recommended targeted screening of high-risk groups in low-incidence countries, however, there remains a lack of consensus regarding cut-offs for the incidence-based screening of high-risk communities, as well as regarding the utility and prioritization of individual risk-factor-based screening of high-risk groups. The utility of the TST compared to IGRAs for LTBI detection in the pediatric population also remains contested. CONCLUSIONS: Relevant strategies for targeted screening in the Canadian Indigenous context include community-level incidence-based screening (screening based on geographic location within high-incidence communities), as well as individual risk-factor-based screening, taking into account pertinent risk factors in Indigenous settings, such as poor housing conditions, malnutrition, contact with an active case, or the presence of relevant co-morbidities, such as renal disease.','Faust L and McCarthy A and Schreiber Y','BMC public health',NULL,'Canada/ethnology,Child,*Child Health,*Cost-Benefit Analysis,Cross-Sectional Studies,*Health Services, Indigenous,Humans,Latent Tuberculosis/*diagnosis/epidemiology/etiology,Mass Screening/*methods,*Population Groups,Risk Factors,Rural Population,Tuberculosis'),(349,2,'19885433','19885433','Local risk factors for implant therapy.','PURPOSE: The aim of this review was to determine the effect of several potential local risk factors on implant survival and success (primary outcomes) as well as on mucosal recession, bleeding on probing, and proximal marginal bone loss (secondary outcomes).

The selection of publications reporting on human clinical studies was based on predetermined inclusion criteria and was agreed upon by three reviewers. After title and abstract screening of 2,681 publications obtained from the search, 19 articles were deemed to be relevant to the topic and the search criteria. RESULTS: Limited data show that when an implant is placed within 3 mm of the neighboring tooth, proximal bone is at risk. The data regarding the placement of implants into infected sites are still insufficient, but studies have shown that this may be possible. Soft tissue thickness has not been shown to be a risk factor in implant survival. There is also no evidence to support a relationship between the width of keratinized tissue and implant survival. No studies were found that directly related bone density to implant survival. Implant stability was also difficult to examine due to the lack of validated stability measures. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: One critical factor that faced the group during the review of the literature and interpretation of the data was the multifactorial nature of implant therapy.

METHODS: The authors performed a systematic review of the English-language literature from 1951 up to December 2015 using the Embase, PubMed, and MEDLINE databases. The following MeSH terms were used in a title and abstract screening: \"radiosurgery\" AND \"trigeminal.\" Of the 585 initial results obtained, the authors performed a full text screening of 185 studies and ultimately found 65 eligible studies. Guideline recommendations were based on level of evidence and level of consensus, the latter predefined as at least 85% agreement among the ISRS guideline committee members. RESULTS: The results for 65 studies (6461 patients) are reported: 45 Gamma Knife RS (GKS) studies (5687 patients [88%]), 11 linear accelerator (LINAC) RS studies (511 patients [8%]), and 9 CyberKnife RS (CKR) studies (263 patients [4%]). With the exception of one prospective study, all studies were retrospective.The mean maximal doses were 71.1-90.1 Gy (prescribed at the 100% isodose line) for GKS, 83.3 Gy for LINAC, and 64.3-80.5 Gy for CKR (the latter two prescribed at the 80% or 90% isodose lines, respectively). The ranges of maximal doses were as follows: 60-97 Gy for GKS, 50-90 Gy for LINAC, and 66-90 Gy for CKR.Actuarial initial freedom from pain (FFP) without medication ranged from 28.6% to 100% (mean 53.1%, median 52.1%) for GKS, from 17.3% to 76% (mean 49.3%, median 43.2%) for LINAC, and from 40% to 72% (mean 56.3%, median 58%) for CKR. Specific to hypesthesia, the crude rates (all Barrow Neurological Institute Pain Intensity Scale scores included) ranged from 0% to 68.8% (mean 21.7%, median 19%) for GKS, from 11.4% to 49.7% (mean 27.6%, median 28.5%) for LINAC, and from 11.8% to 51.2% (mean 29.1%, median 18.7%) for CKR. Other complications included dysesthesias, paresthesias, dry eye, deafferentation pain, and keratitis. Hypesthesia and paresthesia occurred as complications only when the anterior retrogasserian portion of the trigeminal nerve was targeted, whereas the other listed complications occurred when the root entry zone was targeted. Recurrence rates ranged from 0% to 52.2% (mean 24.6%, median 23%) for GKS, from 19% to 63% (mean 32.2%, median 29%) for LINAC, and from 15.8% to 33% (mean 25.8%, median 27.2%) for CKR. Two GKS series reported 30% and 45.3% of patients who were pain free without medication at 10 years.

Additional data sources included the U.S. and European Patent Offices, technical experts, the partner organization, and reference lists. REVIEW METHODS: Studies identified from the data sources went through two levels of title and abstract screening. Passing studies advanced to full text screening. Studies that met the full text screening criteria were abstracted. Criteria for abstraction included publication in any language, human patients of any age, and burns of any type, grade, or total body surface area. All formulations of heparin, and all application methods (e.g., topical, subcutaneous), were eligible for inclusion in the report. Abstracted studies required a comparison group. Outcomes of interest included mortality, pain, length of stay in hospital, thrombosis and emboli, psychiatric adjustment, and adverse effects (e.g., bleeding). RESULTS: Nineteen articles from 18 unique studies were abstracted and included in this report. In these articles, there were multiple uses of heparin to treat burns (e.g., wound healing, inhalation injury, sepsis, pain). However, the overall quality of the articles was weak. Examples of weakness included unclear or inappropriate treatment allocation, no blinding, no control of confounding, poorly defined burn characteristics (e.g., thickness), unclear duration of treatment, incomplete description of heparin treatment, and use of inadequately described or invalid outcome measures. Overall, the evidence from these weak articles was insufficient to determine whether the effectiveness of heparin to treat burn injury was different from the effectiveness of other treatments, or whether treatment effectiveness varied according to (a) the method of applying heparin to (b) burn etiology. Four studies mentioned contraindications to using heparin to treat burns. These contraindications were bleeding diathesis, bleeding history, active bleeding or associated trauma with potential bleeding, active intestinal ulcer, thrombocytopenia, liver disease, renal disorders, or allergy to heparin. CONCLUSIONS: There is no strong evidence in the 19 abstracted articles to suggest that heparin should be used in the treatment of burn injury on account of its non-anticoagulant properties.','Oremus M and Hanson M and Whitlock R and Young E and Gupta A and Dal Cin A and Archer C and Raina P','Evidence report/technology assessment',NULL,'Adult,Burns/*drug therapy,Child,Contraindications,Heparin/adverse effects/*therapeutic use,Heparin, Low-Molecular-Weight/therapeutic use,Humans,Sepsis/drug therapy,Treatment Outcome'),(352,2,'23101052','23101052','(no title found)','BACKGROUND: Electronic searches typically yield far more citations than are relevant, and reviewers spend a substantial amount of time screening titles and abstracts to identify potential studies eligible for inclusion in a review. This is of particular relevance in complex research fields such as quality improvement. We tested a semiautomated literature screening process applied to the title and abstract screening stage of systematic reviews. A machine learning approach may allow literature reviewers to screen only a fraction of a search output and to use a predictive model to learn and then emulate the reviewers\' decisions. Once learned, the model can apply the selection process to an essentially unlimited number of citations. METHOD: Two independent literature reviewers screened 1,591 quasi-randomly selected citations in a training dataset used to predict decisions on the remaining citations in a MEDLINE search output of 9,395 citations. We explored different prediction algorithms and tested results against reference samples screened by experts in quality improvement. Qualitative (relevance cutoff determined in ROC curve) and quantitative predictions (probability rank order of citations) were determined. RESULTS: The agreement between independent literature reviewers ranged from kappa= 0.55 to 0.57. Across two reference samples, the predictive performance of the machine learning approach demonstrated 90.1 percent sensitivity, 43.9 percent specificity, and 32.1 percent PPV. This translates to a reduction of 36.1 percent in citation screening if applied. The predictive performance was affected by reviewer disagreements: a subgroup analysis restricted to citations both reviewers agreed on showed a sensitivity of 98.8 percent (specificity 43.9 percent). CONCLUSION: Machine learning approaches may assist in the title and abstract inclusion screening process in systematic reviews of complex, steadily expanding research fields such as quality improvement. Increased reviewer agreement appeared to be associated with improved predictive performance.','Hempel S and Shetty KD and Shekelle PG and Rubenstein LV and Danz MS and Johnsen B and Dalal SR','',NULL,''),(353,2,'32074291','32074291','Ocular Point-of-Care Ultrasonography to Diagnose Posterior Chamber Abnormalities: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.','Importance: Diagnosing posterior chamber ocular abnormalities typically requires specialist assessment. Point-of-care ultrasonography (POCUS) performed by nonspecialists, if accurate, could negate the need for urgent ophthalmologist evaluation. Objective: This meta-analysis sought to define the diagnostic test characteristics of emergency practitioner-performed ocular POCUS to diagnose multiple posterior chamber abnormalities in adults. Data Sources: PubMed (OVID), MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane, CINAHL, and SCOPUS were searched from inception through June 2019 without restrictions. Conference abstracts and trial registries were also searched. Bibliographies of included studies and relevant reviews were manually searched, and experts in the field were queried. Study Selection: Included studies compared ocular POCUS performed by emergency practitioners with a reference standard of ophthalmologist evaluation. Pediatric studies were excluded. All 116 studies identified during abstract screening as potentially relevant underwent full-text review by multiple authors, and 9 studies were included. Data Extraction and Synthesis: In accordance with PRISMA guidelines, multiple authors extracted data from included studies. Results were meta-analyzed for each diagnosis using a bivariate random-effects model. Data analysis was performed in July 2019. Main Outcomes and Measures: The outcomes of interest were diagnostic test characteristics of ocular POCUS for the following diagnoses: retinal detachment, vitreous hemorrhage, vitreous detachment, intraocular foreign body, globe rupture, and lens dislocation. Results: Nine studies (1189 eyes) were included. All studies evaluated retinal detachment, but up to 5 studies assessed each of the other diagnoses of interest. For retinal detachment, sensitivity was 0.94 (95% CI, 0.88-0.97) and specificity was 0.94 (95% CI, 0.85-0.98).

Sensitivity and specificity were high for lens dislocation (0.97 [95% CI, 0.83-0.99] and 0.99 [95% CI, 0.97-1.00]), intraocular foreign body (1.00 [95% CI, 0.81-1.00] and 0.99 [95% CI, 0.99-1.00]), and globe rupture (1.00 [95% CI, 0.63-1.00] and 0.99 [95% CI, 0.99-1.00]). Results were generally unchanged in sensitivity analyses of studies with low risk of bias. Conclusions and Relevance: This study suggests that emergency practitioner-performed ocular POCUS is an accurate test to assess for retinal detachment in adults. Its utility in diagnosing other posterior chamber abnormalities is promising but needs further study.','Propst SL and Kirschner JM and Strachan CC and Roumpf SK and Menard LM and Sarmiento EJ and Hunter BR','JAMA network open',NULL,'Eye Diseases/*diagnostic imaging,Humans,*Point-of-Care Systems,Posterior Eye Segment/*diagnostic imaging,Retinal Detachment/diagnostic imaging,*Ultrasonography'),(354,2,'32102815','32102815','Use of social media for cancer prevention and early diagnosis: scoping review protocol.','INTRODUCTION: Social media platforms offer unique opportunities for health promotion messages focusing on cancer prevention and early diagnosis. However, there has been very little synthesis of the evaluation of such campaigns, limiting the ability to apply learning to the design of future social media campaigns. We aimed to provide a broad overview of the current research base on social media interventions for cancer prevention and early diagnosis, to identify knowledge gaps and to inform policy, practice and future research questions. METHODS: We will use scoping review methodology to explore the available evidence on social media interventions for cancer prevention and early diagnosis, with a focus on methodological approaches. Quantitative and qualitative studies and reports will be identified through searching several research databases, through internet searching for grey literature and by screening the citations of studies included in the review. All identified studies will undergo independent title and abstract screening and full-text screening against inclusion and exclusion criteria. We plan to chart the data from included studies to record the characteristics of the social media interventions, resources, activities, outputs, outcomes and impact. Charted data will be collated and summarised using a narrative synthesis. The interpretation and implications of the findings will be enhanced by consultation with relevant stakeholders such as public health organisations, cancer charities, and patient and public involvement groups when preliminary results are available. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval is not required for this scoping review. The results will be used to identify research questions for future systematic reviews and to inform the development of future social media interventions. We will disseminate findings in peer-reviewed journals and at relevant conferences.','Kaushal A and Kassianos AP and Sheringham J and Waller J and von Wagner C','BMJ open',NULL,''),(355,2,'28937462','28937462','Instability in Thoracolumbar Trauma: Is a New Definition Warranted?','STUDY DESIGN: Review of the articles. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to review all articles related to spinal instability to determine a consensus statement for a contemporary, practical definition applicable to thoracolumbar injuries. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Traumatic fractures of the thoracolumbar spine are common. These injuries can result in neurological deficits, disability, deformity, pain, and represent a great economic burden to society. The determination of spinal instability is an important task for spine surgeons, as treatment strategies rely heavily on this assessment. However, a clinically applicable definition of spinal stability remains elusive. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A review of the Medline database between 1930 and 2014 was performed limited to papers in English. Spinal instability, thoracolumbar, and spinal stability were used as search terms. Case reports were excluded. We reviewed listed references from pertinent search results and located relevant manuscripts from these lists as well. RESULTS: The search produced a total of 694 published articles. Twenty-five articles were eligible after abstract screening and underwent full review. A definition for spinal instability was described in only 4 of them. Definitions were primarily based on biomechanical and classification studies. No definitive parameters were outlined to define stability. CONCLUSIONS: Thirty-six years after White and Panjabi\'s original definition of instability, and many classification schemes later, there remains no practical and meaningful definition for spinal instability in thoracolumbar trauma. Surgeon expertise and experience remains an important factor in stability determination. We propose that, at an initial assessment, a distinction should be made between immediate and delayed instability. This designation should better guide surgeons in decision making and patient counseling.','Abbasi Fard S and Skoch J and Avila MJ and Patel AS and Sattarov KV and Walter CM and Baaj AA','Clinical spine surgery',NULL,'Humans,Joint Instability/*pathology,Lumbar Vertebrae/*pathology,Spinal Fractures/pathology,Spinal Injuries/*pathology,Thoracic Vertebrae/*pathology'),(356,2,'32809854','32809854','The management of depression following traumatic brain injury: A systematic review with meta-analysis.','BACKGROUND: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is prevalent. Declining mortality has led to increasing survivors with chronic sequalae, including depression. With a lack of guidelines, this review aims to provide a comprehensive, evidence-based summary of the management of depression following TBI. METHODS: Systematic searches were conducted for quasi-experimental and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing pharmacotherapy, psychological interventions, and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Databases searched CENTRAL, Medline, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and ProQuest dissertations. Data extraction and risk-of-bias tools were used. Where possible, outcomes were combined into meta-analyses. RESULTS: 2719 studies were identified. After abstract screening and full-text reading, 34 remained. Prophylactic sertraline significantly reduced the odds of depression (OR (odds ratio) = 0.31 [95%CI (confidence interval) = 0.12 to 0.82]). Meta-analysis of RCT\'s showed TMS to have the greatest reduction in depression severity (SMD (Standardized-Mean-Difference) = 2.43 [95%CI = 1.24 to 3.61]). Stimulants were the only treatment superior to control (SMD = -1.03 [95%CI = - 1.6 to -0.47]). CONCLUSION: Methylphenidate was the most effective pharmacotherapy. Sertraline appears effective for prevention. The efficacy of psychological interventions is unclear. TMS as a combination therapy appears promising. Heterogeneity of study populations and dearth of evidence means results should be interpreted cautiously.','Beedham W and Belli A and Ingaralingam S and Haque S and Upthegrove R','Brain injury',NULL,''),(357,2,'31526595','31526595','The preliminary validation of laser Doppler flowmetry in systemic sclerosis in accordance with the OMERACT filter: A systematic review.','OBJECTIVES: To investigate the validation status of laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) in systemic sclerosis (SSc) according to the \'Outcome Measures in Rheumatologic Clinical Trials\' (OMERACT) filter. METHODS: The literature was systematically reviewed to identify all reports assessing the microcirculatory flow in SSc patients. The OMERACT filter -including the domains of truth, discrimination and feasibility- was applied and a quality assessment was done by the \'Good Methods Checklist\'. To ease the comparison between studies the results were grouped per dynamic test situation: basal, cold/heat challenge and occlusion. RESULTS: The literature search resulted in 4332 hits. Based on title and abstract screening 243 hits were retained and of these, 52 full texts described an assessment by LDF in SSc patients. Finally, 18 studies passed the quality assessment and form the object of this review. The review reveals that expert consensus is lacking on the face and content validity of LDF in SSc. The construct validity of LDF, on the other hand is partially validated. Conflicting results exist on the discriminant capacity of LDF in distinguishing healthy from diseased patients, primary from secondary Raynaud\'s phenomenon and in differentiating between disease subsets. Yet, complementing an LDF-measurement with a heat challenge, as well as the evaluation of the post-occlusive hyperaemic response, has the potential to elicit a difference between healthy and diseased patients. Lastly, data on the feasibility of LDF in SSc is lacking in the identified literature. CONCLUSION: This systematic review emphasizes the very preliminary validation status of LDF in the assessment of the microcirculatory flow in SSc.','Melsens K and Van Impe S and Paolino S and Vanhaecke A and Cutolo M and Smith V','Seminars in arthritis and rheumatism',NULL,''),(358,2,'22912869','22912869','Anterior cervical discectomy with arthroplasty versus arthrodesis for single-level cervical spondylosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis.','OBJECTIVE: To estimate the effectiveness of anterior cervical discectomy with arthroplasty (ACDA) compared to anterior cervical discectomy with fusion (ACDF) for patient-important outcomes for single-level cervical spondylosis. DATA SOURCES: Electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Register for Randomized Controlled Trials, BIOSIS and LILACS), archives of spine meetings and bibliographies of relevant articles. STUDY SELECTION: We included RCTs of ACDF versus ACDA in adult patients with single-level cervical spondylosis reporting at least one of the following outcomes: functionality, neurological success, neck pain, arm pain, quality of life, surgery for adjacent level degeneration (ALD), reoperation and dysphonia/dysphagia. We used no language restrictions. We performed title and abstract screening and full text screening independently and in duplicate. DATA SYNTHESIS: We used random-effects model to pool data using mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes and relative risk (RR) for dichotomous outcomes. We used GRADE to evaluate the quality of evidence for each outcome. RESULTS: Of 2804 citations, 9 articles reporting on 9 trials (1778 participants) were eligible. ACDA is associated with a clinically significant lower incidence of neurologic failure (RR = 0.53, 95% CI = 0.37-0.75, p = 0.0004) and improvement in the Neck pain visual analogue scale (VAS) (MD = 6.56, 95% CI = 3.22-9.90, p = 0.0001; Minimal clinically important difference (MCID) = 2.5. ACDA is associated with a statistically but not clinically significant improvement in Arm pain VAS and SF-36 physical component summary. ACDA is associated with non-statistically significant higher improvement in the Neck Disability Index Score and lower incidence of ALD requiring surgery, reoperation, and dysphagia/dysphonia. CONCLUSIONS: There is no strong evidence to support the routine use of ACDA over ACDF in single-level cervical spondylosis. Current trials lack long-term data required to assess safety as well as surgery for ALD. We suggest that ACDA in patients with single level cervical spondylosis is an option although its benefits and indication over ACDF remain in question.','Fallah A and Akl EA and Ebrahim S and Ibrahim GM and Mansouri A and Foote CJ and Zhang Y and Fehlings MG','PloS one',NULL,'Arthroplasty/*methods,Cervical Vertebrae/*surgery,Diskectomy/*methods,Humans,Outcome Assessment, Health Care/methods,Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic,Spinal Fusion/*methods,Spondylosis/pathology/*surgery'),(359,2,'32697712','32697712','Efficacy of Triple Chronotherapy in unipolar and bipolar depression: A systematic review of the available evidence.','BACKGROUND: Given the strong relationship between circadian rhythm disruption and mood regulation, combined chronotherapeutic approaches have been proposed for mood disorders. However, a comprehensive review of the available evidence on the efficacy of such interventions for depression is lacking. AIM: To systematically review available literature on Triple Chronotherapy (Sleep Deprivation - Sleep Phase Advance - Bright Light Therapy) for depressive symptoms in Major Depression and Bipolar Depression. METHODS: We followed the PRISMA statement for systematic reviews to conduct a web-based search on PubMed, Scopus and Embase using a list of selected keywords relevant to depression and chronotherapy. RESULTS: After title and abstract screening of the 321 records retrieved, 25 potentially eligible studies were assessed at full-text screening. Nineteen studies were excluded for failure to match inclusion criteria. Six records of Triple Chronotherapy in addition to conventional treatment, published between 2009 and 2019, were included in the revision. All studies reported significant improvements on HAM-D scores at the end of treatment, with 50% to 84% response rates. Efficacy of treatment was confirmed on follow-up by three studies, with 58% to 61% response rates. Remission rates varied from 33,3% to 77%. Reported side effects were negligible across studies. LIMITATIONS: Available trials are very few and only one included a control group treated with a daily exercise program.

METHODS: A systematic search of MEDLINE, Embase, EconLit and the Cochrane Library databases used free text and Medical Subject Headings terms including psoriasis, biologic therapies indicated for psoriasis, and all types of economic evaluations. Two researchers performed 2-level abstract screening for articles meeting pre-specified inclusion criteria. Assumptions about treatment pathways after first-line biologic failure in the cost-effectiveness models were analysed. A second systematic search was performed for psoriasis clinical practice guidelines. Sequence assumptions were compared with treatment guideline recommendations. RESULTS: Of 25 cost-effectiveness modelling studies identified, ten estimated the incremental cost per responder; time horizons varied (12 weeks-18 months) and treatment sequencing was not considered. In 15 studies where treatment sequencing was considered, with time horizons up to 10 years, five studies included only a switch to nonsystemic therapy or best supportive care after first-line biologic failure. Another five of the 15 treatment-pathway studies were available only as abstracts with no details of the sequence assumptions. In five of the 15 studies, first-line biologic failure was followed by second-line biologic monotherapy, one of the recommendations in current treatment guidelines. In only one of these five studies was the efficacy of the second-line biologic adjusted downwards, compared with first-line treatment. Only one of these studies considered dose titration with a first-line biologic and none combination therapy (biologic plus methotrexate or phototherapy) after first-line biologic failure, as recommended in some treatment guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: Cost-effectiveness models of first-line biologics for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis either do not include subsequent treatment regimens or include only some of the regimens recommended in current treatment guidelines. Results may be sensitive to assumptions about treatment sequencing and the choice and efficacy of subsequent treatment regimens.','Mauskopf J and Samuel M and McBride D and Mallya UG and Feldman SR','PharmacoEconomics',NULL,'Cost-Benefit Analysis,Dermatologic Agents/economics/therapeutic use,Humans,Immunologic Factors/economics/*therapeutic use,*Models, Economic,Practice Guidelines as Topic,Psoriasis/*drug therapy/economics/pathology,Severity of Illness Index,Treatment Failure,Treatment Outcome'),(361,2,'20429823','20429823','Burden of illness of diabetic macular edema: literature review.','OBJECTIVE: To provide an overview of the literature on the burden of diabetic macular edema (DME) in the United States and selected European countries. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Computerized searches of English-language literature were conducted in PubMed/MEDLINE (1980-2009). The searches were supplemented with electronic and manual searches of relevant society/association proceedings and bibliographies of electronically identified sources. Abstracts were reviewed for relevance to any of the following topics: epidemiology, including prevalence and incidence; health outcomes; resource use and treatment patterns; and economic and humanistic burden associated with DME. Relevant full text articles were retrieved and major findings were synthesized and compared within and across countries. RESULTS: A total of 400 citations were included in the initial review. After abstract screening, 47 articles were deemed pertinent and summarized in this review. The prevalence of DME among diabetic patients ranged from 0.85% to 12.3% across the countries studied. The prevalence and incidence of DME vary depending on type of diabetes (1 vs. 2), insulin- vs. non-insulin-dependence, and duration of disease (years since diagnosis). Although literature findings are limited and indicate a need for further investigation, a synthesis of the available results indicates that DME has a negative impact on patients\' health-related quality of life. In addition, patients with DME consume significantly more healthcare resources and incur higher costs compared to diabetic patients without retinal complications.

Data of demographic and characteristics of included studies and patients was extracted and tabulated. RESULTS: Ten studies were eligible for our criteria and were included in this systematic review. Age of participants ranged between 17-65 years. Only two subjects showed PM phenotype of CYP2C19 in Saudi population. The most frequent alleles were CYP2C19*1 (62.9%), CYP2C19*2 (11.2%-32%), and CYP2C19*17 (25.7%). The CYP2C19m1 was observed in 97 cases of extensive metabolizing (EM) phenotype CYP2C19. Concerning the CYP2C9, the most frequent alleles were CYP2C9*1 and CYP2C9*2, and the most frequent genotype was CYP2C9*1*1. The CYP2D6*41 allele and C1236T MDR1 were the most frequent allele in this population. CONCLUSION: The current evidence suggests that Saudi Arabians resembled European in the frequency of CYP2C19, Caucasians in both the incidence of CYP2C9 and CYP2C19m1 and absence of CYP2C19m2. The CYP2D6*41 allele frequency in Saudi Arabians is relatively high.

There is scarce epidemiological data on patients with GSM as a distinct subgroup of GBM. METHODS: A systematic literature review was performed of peer-reviewed databases using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines to evaluate the impact of race and ethnicity on survival in patients with GSM compared to patients with GBM. RESULTS: Following initial abstract screening, a total of 138 articles pertaining to GSM and 275 pertaining to GBM met criteria for full-text review, with 5 and 27 articles included in the final analysis for GSM and GBM, respectively. The majority of patients in both cohorts were non-Hispanic Whites, representing 85.6 % of total GSM patients and 87.7 % of GBM patients analyzed. Two GSM studies stratified survival by race, with one reporting the longest median survival for the Hispanic population of 10.6 months and the shortest median survival for the Asian population of 9 months. Among the GBM studies analyzed, the majority of studies reported shorter survival and higher risk of mortality among White Non-Hispanics compared to non-White patients; and of the 15 studies which reported data for the Asian population, 12 studies reported this race category to have the longest survival compared to all other races studied. Younger age, female sex, MGMT promoter methylation status, and adjuvant chemoradiation therapy were associated with improved survival in both GSM and GBM cohorts, although these were not further stratified by race. CONCLUSION: GSM portends a similarly poor prognosis to other GBM subtypes; however, few studies exist which have examined factors associated with differences in survival between these histologic variants. This review of the literature suggests there is a possible association between race and survival for patients with GBM, however data supporting this conclusion for patients with GSM is lacking. These findings suggest that GSM is a distinct disease from other GBM subtypes, with epidemiologic differences that should be further explored.','Gerges C and Elder T and Penuela M and Rossetti N and Maynard M and Jeong S and Wright CH and Wright J and Zhou X and Burant C and Sajatovic M and Hodges T','Clinical neurology and neurosurgery',NULL,''),(365,2,'31368371','31368371','Evidence for managing chronic low back pain in primary care: a review of recommendations from high-quality clinical practice guidelines.','Aim: Chronic low back pain represents a major problem throughout the world which is increasing largely because of the aging world population.

Summarizing landscape factors and satellite EO data sources, and making the information public are helpful for guiding future research and improving health decision-making. In this case, a review of the literature would appear to be an appropriate tool. However, this is not an easy-to-use tool. The review process mainly includes defining the topic, searching, screening at both title/abstract and full-text levels and data extraction that needs consistent knowledge from experts and is time-consuming and labor intensive. In this context, this study integrates the review process, text scoring, active learning (AL) mechanism, and bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) networks, and proposes a semi-supervised text classification framework that enables the efficient and accurate selection of the relevant articles. Specifically, text scoring and BiLSTM-based active learning were used to replace the title/abstract screening and full-text screening, respectively, which greatly reduces the human workload. In this study, 101 relevant articles were selected from 4 bibliographic databases, and a catalogue of essential dengue landscape factors was identified and divided into four categories: land use (LU), land cover (LC), topography and continuous land surface features. Moreover, various satellite EO sensors and products used for identifying landscape factors were tabulated. Finally, possible future directions of applying satellite EO data in dengue research in terms of landscape patterns, satellite sensors and deep learning were proposed. The proposed semi-supervised text classification framework was successfully applied in research evidence synthesis that could be easily applied to other topics, particularly in an interdisciplinary context.','Li Z and Gurgel H and Dessay N and Hu L and Xu L and Gong P','International journal of environmental research and public health',NULL,''),(368,2,'23305808','23305808','Does combination pharmacological intervention for smoking cessation prevent post-cessation weight gain?

OBJECTIVE: To conduct a systematic review to evaluate if combination pharmacological therapy interventions for smoking cessation are effective in reducing post-cessation weight gain. METHODS: The following databases were researched: Medline, PubMed, PsycINFO, CENTRAL and EMBASE. Detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria were specified a priori before conducting abstract and full text screening. Included studies were required to: (1) report data on combination pharmacotherapy including at least one FDA-approved smoking cessation medication; (2) report outcome measure of weight change from baseline to the end of follow up; (3) incorporate a minimum of 2-week follow-up; (4) recruit adult smokers. Studies were excluded if they had (1) behavioral interventions; (2) sample size of <30; (3) switching medications; or (4) they were not written in English. Abstracts and the full texts were reviewed independently by two investigators. Inclusion of studies was decided by a third independent investigator in case of disagreement between the two primary investigators. RESULTS: Out of 1873 studies identified, 1083 studies were included for abstract screening. Finally, 12 studies met the eligibility criteria after full text screening of 242 studies. Seven studies showed that participants in the combined therapy group had less post-cessation weight gain than those in the group of individual drugs or placebo. Four studies did not report differential weight gain measures by treatment groups. Only one study showed that post-treatment weight gain in the combined therapy group was more than the monotherapy group, although the result was not statistically significant.

Through thematic synthesis we identified 32 initial codes that were grouped into 5 second-order themes: (1) case manager had four associated codes and described preferences for the case manager personal and professional attributes, including a sound knowledge in dementia and availability of local services; (2) communication had five associated codes and emphasized the importance stakeholders placed on multichannel communication with service users, as well as between multidisciplinary teams and across organisations; (3) intervention had 11 associated codes which focused primarily on the practicalities of implementation such as the contact type and frequency between case managers and service users, and the importance of case manager training and service evaluation; (4) resources had five associated codes which outlined stakeholder views on the required resources for coordinating interventions and potential overlap with existing resources, as well as arising issues when available resources do not meet those required for successful implementation; and (5) support had seven associated codes that reflect the importance that was placed on the support network around the case manager and the investment of professionals involved directly in care as well as the wider professional network. CONCLUSION: The synthesis of relevant qualitative studies has shown how various stakeholder groups considered dementia care coordination interventions to be acceptable, useful and appropriate for dementia care, and have clear preferences for components, implementation methods and settings of these interventions. By incorporating stakeholders\' perspectives and preferences when planning and developing coordinating interventions we may increase the likelihood of successful implementation and patient benefits.','Backhouse A and Richards DA and McCabe R and Watkins R and Dickens C','BMC health services research',NULL,'Case Management,Communication,Community Networks,Dementia/*therapy,Humans,*Patient Care Planning,Qualitative Research'),(370,2,'30192317','30192317','Meta-analytic and Scoping Study on Strength Training in People With Multiple Sclerosis.','Manca, A, Dvir, Z, and Deriu, F.

Recent epidemiological data, for example, show that waterpipe smoking has become the most prevalent tobacco use method among adolescents in the EMR, and the second most prevalent in the US. Waterpipes are used socially, often being shared between friends or family at home, or in dedicated bars and cafes that provide waterpipes to patrons. Because the smoke passes through a reservoir of water, waterpipe tobacco smoking is perceived as being less harmful than other methods of tobacco use. At least in some cultures, women and girls are more likely to use a waterpipe than to use other forms of tobacco, and it is popular among younger smokers. Accumulating evidence suggests that some waterpipe smokers become addicted, have difficulty quitting, and experience similar health risks as cigarette smokers. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of tobacco cessation interventions for waterpipe users. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Review Group specialized register in June 2015. We also searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and CINAHL , using variant terms and spellings (\'waterpipe\' or \'narghile\' or \'arghile\' or \'shisha\' or \'goza\' or \'narkeela\' or \'hookah\' or \'hubble bubble\'). We searched for trials, published or unpublished, in any language, and especially in regions where waterpipe use is widespread. SELECTION CRITERIA: We sought randomized, quasi-randomized or cluster-randomized controlled trials of smoking cessation interventions for waterpipe smokers of any age or gender. The primary outcome of interest was abstinence from tobacco use, measured at six months post-cessation or longer, regardless of whether abstinence was biochemically verified. We included interventions that were pharmacological (for example, nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) or bupropion) or behavioural, or both, and could be directed at individual waterpipe users or at groups of users. We only included tobacco cessation interventions, and did not consider trials of prevention of uptake. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors assessed abstracts of the studies retrieved by the search strategy, for possible inclusion in the review. We retrieved full-text articles for all abstracts that any of the authors believed might be suitable. Two review authors then extracted data and assessed trial quality independently in accordance with standard Cochrane Collaboration methodologies. We aimed to pool groups of studies that we considered to be sufficiently similar, provided there was no evidence of substantial statistical heterogeneity, and aimed to estimate a pooled risk ratio (RR) using the Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect method. Where meta-analysis was not possible, we presented summary and descriptive statistics. MAIN RESULTS: Our search retrieved 1311 unique citations, of which 1289 were excluded after title and abstract screening. Of the remaining 22, we excluded 19 because they were empirical studies that were not randomized, quasi-randomized or cluster-randomized controlled trials (n = 12), because they were review articles (n = 3), because they described protocols only (n = 2), they were conducted among cigarette smokers only (n = 1), or they had only a three-month follow-up (n = 1).We identified three controlled trials which tested cessation interventions for waterpipe smokers. Studies were carried out in Egypt (Mohlman 2013), Pakistan (Dogar 2014), and the US (Lipkus 2011). One was a randomized controlled trial and two were cluster-randomized trials. Two studies tested individual-level interventions, and one tested a community-level intervention. Two studies included only behavioural interventions, and one study (Dogar 2014) included two intervention groups: one behavioural, and the other behavioural with bupropion. The Lipkus and Mohlman studies delivered waterpipe-specific interventions, and the Dogar study delivered a non-specific tobacco intervention. Due to study variation we did not pool results, and intervention effects are reported descriptively. Compared to control groups, waterpipe smoking cessation rates were higher in the intervention groups in all three studies, with a significant difference in two studies. For the Dogar study, the RRs for waterpipe smoking abstinence at 25 weeks among waterpipe-only smokers were 2.2 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3 to 3.8; 180 participants) in the behavioural group, and 2.5 (95% CI 1.3 to 4.7; 84 participants) in the behavioural plus bupropion group. In our analysis we have combined both groups, to give a RR of 2.28 (95% CI 1.36 to 3.83; 200 participants). The Mohlman study delivered a RR in male waterpipe-smokers at one year in favour of the intervention of 3.25 (95% CI 1.19 to 8.89). AUTHORS\' CONCLUSIONS: Although the literature on waterpipe cessation interventions remains sparse, the reviewed studies provide a basis for developing interventions in this area. The lack of statistically significant effects in one of the three studies is not unexpected, given the small and pilot nature of the studies. The studies highlight important design and content issues that need to be considered for future cessation trials in waterpipe smokers. These include building on the vast experience developed in the study of smoking cessation interventions in cigarette smokers, whilst including components and assessment tools that address the specific aspects of waterpipe smoking, such as its social dimension, unique experiences, and cues.','Maziak W and Jawad M and Jawad S and Ward KD and Eissenberg T and Asfar T','The Cochrane database of systematic reviews',NULL,'Bupropion/therapeutic use,Female,Humans,Male,Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic,Smoking Cessation/methods/statistics & numerical data,*Smoking Prevention,Tobacco Use Cessation/*methods/statistics & numerical data,*Water'),(374,2,'28482504','28482504','Bioactive glass for dentin remineralization: A systematic review.','BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Strategies to achieve dentin remineralization is at present an important target of restorative dentistry. Remineralization of dentin by a bioactive material is complete only when the tissue regains its functionality. This is achieved when there is adequate apatite formation which most importantly translates into improved mechanical properties of dentin as a result of intrafibrillar mineralization. Bioactive glass (BAG) is a well-known implant material for bone regeneration and is proven to have excellent ability of apatite formation. Hence, recent studies have proposed BAGs as one of the most desired materials for remineralization of dentin. Therefore the aim of this systematic review was to scope the evidence of bioactive glass to remineralize dentin. METHODS: The following research question was formulated: \"Is there strong evidence for bioactive glass to remineralize dentin?\" Three databases (Web of science, PubMed and Science direct) were scanned independently following PRISMA guidelines. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were set to identify relevant articles based on title and abstract screening. Finally, potentially relevant articles were downloaded and the full text was scrutinized to select the articles included in this review. RESULTS: The first phase of search returned 303 articles. A total of 19 papers with full text were scrutinized for inclusion, of which 3 papers were chosen for the final synthesis. All three studies confirm that BAG treatment leads to enhanced apatite formation in dentin. Only 1 of the 3 studies has reported the mechanical properties of dentin after BAG treatment and it revealed that the Young\'s modulus and flexural bend strength of BAG treated dentin were much lower than natural dentin even though they had similar apatite content. CONCLUSIONS: This review highlights the importance of assessing the mechanical properties of dentin alongside to the newly formed apatite content in order to prove BAGs efficiency to remineralize this tissue. Though studies have confirmed that BAGs stimulate excellent apatite formation in dentin, it should be concluded that there isn\'t sufficient evidence for bioactive glass to effectively remineralize this tissue as the mechanical properties of the BAG treated dentin haven\'t been well explored.','Fernando D and Attik N and Pradelle-Plasse N and Jackson P and Grosgogeat B and Colon P','Materials science & engineering.

Our goal is to elucidate the best route of administration for lavender as a treatment for anxiety. METHODS: Thirteen electronic search engines were systematically scanned for relevant publications. The relevant articles were included after the title and abstract screening followed by the full-text screening. This study included randomized control trials reporting lavender for the treatment of anxiety. The protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42017076711). Frequentist network meta-analysis and Bayesian meta-regression were conducted to report the best treatment modality and the effect of covariates on the effectiveness as an anxiolytic. Treatment arms were ordered according P-scores, where higher P-score indicates better treatment choice. RESULTS: Forty studies were eligible for qualitative analysis, and 32 were included in quantitative analysis. Lavender aromatherapy was the best approach for the treatment of anxiety among other lavender modalities at the first week recording [Standardized Mean Difference (SMD) = -0.57, 95% CI (-1.14-0.01), P-score = 0.72], in addition to achieve at the first time points [SMD = -0, 95% CI (-0.97 -0.16), P-score = 0.69], compared to placebo; however, lavender massage along with foot bath were found to be the most efficacious for anxiety treatment at the study endpoint [SMD = -1.10, 95% CI = (-7.41 5.21), P-score = 0.65]. Furthermore, network meta-regression revealed that the duration of therapy influenced treatment, suggesting Silexan (oral lavender) 80 mg (first rank probability = .116) as the favorable option for anxiety in long-term treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Lavender aromatherapy is, clinically, superior in short-duration, while Silexan (oral lavender) 80 mg is preferable for long-term treatment of anxiety.','Sayed AM and Morsy S and Tawfik GM and Naveed S and Minh-Duc NT and Hieu TH and Ali ZA and Shinkar A and Doheim MF and Hashan MR and Huy NT','General hospital psychiatry',NULL,''),(376,2,'30510576','30510576','Efficacy of Dental Bleaching with Whitening Dentifrices: A Systematic Review.','A systematic review was performed to evaluate whether whitening toothpastes promote tooth whitening when compared to the use of conventional (nonbleaching) dentifrices.

It is hypothesized that continuous fetal monitoring could detect these signs more accurately and objectively than current forms of fetal monitoring and allow for timely intervention. This systematic review aimed to explore available evidence on women\'s experiences of continuous fetal monitoring to investigate its acceptability before clinical implementation and to inform clinical studies. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Systematic searching of four electronic databases (Embase, PsycINFO, MEDLINE and CINAHL), using key terms defined by initial scoping searches, identified a total of 35 studies. Following title and abstract screening by two independent researchers, five studies met the inclusion criteria. Studies were not excluded based on language, methodology or quality assessment. An integrative methodology was used to synthesize qualitative and quantitative data together. RESULTS: Forms of continuous fetal monitoring used included Monica AN24 monitors (n = 4) and phonocardiography (n = 1). Four main themes were identified: practical limitations of the device, negative emotions, positive perceptions, and device implementation. Continuous fetal monitoring was reported to have high levels of participant satisfaction and was preferred by women to intermittent cardiotocography. CONCLUSION: This review suggests that continuous fetal monitoring is accepted by women. However, it has also highlighted both the paucity and heterogeneity of current studies and suggests that further research should be conducted into women\'s experiences of continuous fetal monitoring before such devices can be used clinically.','Crawford A and Hayes D and Johnstone ED and Heazell AEP','Acta obstetricia et gynecologica Scandinavica',NULL,'Female,Fetal Monitoring/*methods,Humans,*Patient Acceptance of Health Care,Pregnancy'),(379,2,'31456550','31456550','Detection of splenic microabscesses with ultrasound as a marker for extrapulmonary tuberculosis in patients with HIV: A systematic review.','BACKGROUND: In 2015, 1.2 million new cases of tuberculosis (TB) were diagnosed in patients with HIV. Diagnostic limitations and resource shortages in endemic areas can delay diagnosis and treatment, particularly with extrapulmonary TB (EPTB). Research suggests that ultrasound can identify splenic microabscesses caused by EPTB, but data are limited on the frequency of this finding in patients with culture-proven EPTB. OBJECTIVES: To estimate the frequency of splenic EPTB microabscesses detected with ultrasound in patients with HIV and TB co-infection. METHODS: Studies published in six major databases as of November 2017 were systematically reviewed based on the PRISMA guidelines. Cohen\'s kappa test was used to determine inter-rater agreement. Articles included for data abstraction passed the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) evaluation. Freeman-Tukey transformation was used to calculate weighted proportions. Heterogeneity was evaluated by Forest plot and I2 calculation. RESULTS: After abstract screening, article review and QUADAS-2 evaluation, five studies were selected for data extraction. A total of 774 patients in these studies were infected with HIV. Splenic lesions were seen with ultrasound in 21.0% of patients with HIV (95% confidence interval (CI) 10.6 - 33.8). TB diagnosed by culture, biopsy, smear, or molecular methods was found to be the cause of 88.3% (95% CI 72.3 - 97.9) of splenic microabscesses seen on ultrasound in patients with HIV. CONCLUSIONS: Ultrasound evaluation of the spleen in patients with HIV and symptoms suggestive of TB in endemic regions is a viable diagnostic adjunct. Ultrasound detection of splenic microabscesses in HIV patients is probably sufficient indication to initiate TB treatment prior to obtaining culture data.

The success of health care interventions depends on nurses\' ability and willingness to provide quality health care services. A well-implemented performance management (PM) system can be a valuable asset in ensuring that nurses are motivated, promoted, trained and rewarded appropriately. Despite the significant benefits of effective PM such as improved motivation, job satisfaction and morale, PM systems are highly contested. Therefore, it is important to examine evidence on PM methods and practices in order to understand its consequences among nursing professionals in primary health care (PHC) settings. METHODS: The search strategy of this systematic scoping review will involve various electronic databases which include Academic Search Complete, PsycARTICLES. PsycINFO, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Applied Health Literature, Medline and Cochrane Library from the EbsocHost Database Platform. Electronic databases such as PubMed and Google Scholar, Union catalogue of theses and dissertations via SABINET online and WorldCat dissertations will be incorporated. A grey literature search will be conducted on websites such as the World Health Organization and government websites to find relevant policies and guidelines. The period for the search is from 1978 to 2018. This time period was chosen to coincide with the Declaration of Alma-Ata on PHC adopted in 1978. All references will be exported to Endnote library. Two independent reviewers will begin screening for eligible titles, abstracts and full articles. During title and abstract screening, duplicates will be removed. The Mixed Method Appraisal Tool will determine the quality of included studies. Thematic analysis will be used to analyse the included articles. DISCUSSION: Evidence of preferences on PM methods and practices will generate insight on the use of PM systems in PHC and how this can be used for the purpose of improving nurses\' performance and in turn, the provision of quality health care.

There is an opportunity to better understand PCC in dietetics. Thus, the present integrative review aims to critically synthesise literature relating to PCC in dietetics. METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted between February and March 2016. Studies were included if they (i) involved dietitians and/or patients who had participated in an individual dietetic consultation; (ii) related to one or more components of PCC; and (iii) were empirical full-text studies in English, involving adult participants, published between 1997 and 2016. Following title and abstract screening, full texts were retrieved and independently assessed for inclusion by two of the investigators. Two independent investigators conducted data extraction and quality assessment using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. Study findings were analysed thematically using meta-synthesis. Twenty-seven studies met the inclusion criteria. RESULTS: Six themes were discovered inductively: (i) establishing a positive dietitian-patient relationship; (ii) displaying humanistic behaviours; (iii) using effective communication skills; (iv) individualising and adapting care; (v) redistributing power to the patient; and (vi) lacking time for PCC practices. The first three themes were closely related. Studies used a broad range of methodological designs. Limitations of the studies included a lack of reflexivity and a lack of representativeness of the study population.

OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of published studies to evaluate the association between endogenous testosterone and mortality. DATA SOURCES: Data sources included MEDLINE (1966 to December 2010), EMBASE (1988 to December 2010), and reference lists. STUDY SELECTION: Eligible studies were published English-language observational studies of men that reported the association between endogenous testosterone and all-cause or cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality. A two-stage process was used for study selection. 1) Working independently and in duplicate, reviewers screened a subset (10%) of abstracts. Results indicated 96% agreement, and thereafter, abstract screening was conducted in singlicate. 2) All full-text publications were reviewed independently and in duplicate for eligibility. DATA EXTRACTION: Reviewers working independently and in duplicate determined methodological quality of studies and extracted descriptive, quality, and outcome data. DATA SYNTHESIS: Of 820 studies identified, 21 were included in the systematic review, and 12 were eligible for meta-analysis [n = 11 studies of all-cause mortality (16,184 subjects); n = 7 studies of CVD mortality (11,831 subjects)]. Subject mean age and testosterone level were 61 yr and 487 ng/dl, respectively, and mean follow-up time was 9.7 yr. Between-study heterogeneity was observed among studies of all-cause (P < .001) and CVD mortality (P = 0.06), limiting the ability to provide valid summary estimates. Heterogeneity in all-cause mortality (higher relative risks) was observed in studies that included older subjects (P = 0.020), reported lower testosterone levels (P = 0.018), followed subjects for a shorter time period (P = 0.010), and sampled blood throughout the day (P = 0.030). CONCLUSION: Low endogenous testosterone levels are associated with increased risk of all-cause and CVD death in community-based studies of men, but considerable between-study heterogeneity, which was related to study and subject characteristics, suggests that effects are driven by differences between cohorts (e.g. in underlying health status).','Araujo AB and Dixon JM and Suarez EA and Murad MH and Guey LT and Wittert GA','The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism',NULL,'Adult,Age Factors,Aged,Body Mass Index,Cardiovascular Diseases/mortality,Cause of Death,Humans,Male,Meta-Analysis as Topic,Middle Aged,Mortality/*trends,Risk Assessment,Smoking/adverse effects,Survival,Testosterone/blood/*deficiency/*physiology,United States'),(386,2,'30344171','30344171','Decision-making on the location of care of the elderly: protocol for a systematic review of qualitative studies.','INTRODUCTION: The elderly must take part in the management of their own health. One of the aspects they should be able to decide on is the place where they want to live. The aim of this review is to synthetise qualitative evidence in order to understand how decisions are made on the location of care of the elderly. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Systematic review of qualitative studies. Six databases have been consulted: Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL Complete, PsycINFO and SciELO Citation Index (from the beginning to 29 November 2017). The inclusion criteria will be: studies that deal with the decision-making process on the location of care of the elderly (already experienced by the participants), original studies, qualitative or mixed-method studies and studies written in English or Spanish. The obtained results will be exported to the Zotero bibliography manager. The references will be reviewed by title and abstract and, later, the complete texts will be reviewed for their inclusion. A tool created for this study will be used to extract the data. The quality will be assessed with Critical Appraisal Skills Programme Espanol. The data synthesis will be carried out using the constant comparative method. All this process will be performed independently by two reviewers. Enhancing transparency in reporting the synthesis of qualitative research has been used to draw up this protocol. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This protocol did not require ethical approval, since it is a protocol for a systematic review. The plans to disseminate our results include publishing a research paper in a high-impact journal in our study area. Also, if possible, our results will be presented in scientific conferences. Besides, the obtained results will complement and discuss the doctoral thesis of one of the authors of the review.

Nurse staffing levels and staff mix vary from country to country, as well as between care settings. Understanding how staffing skill mix impacts patient, organizational, and financial outcomes is critical in order to allow policymakers and clinicians to make evidence-informed staffing decisions. AIMS: This paper reports on the methodology for creation of an electronic database of studies exploring the effectiveness of Registered Nurses (RNs) on clinical and patient outcomes, organizational and nurse outcomes, and financial outcomes. METHODS: Comprehensive literature searches were conducted in four electronic databases. Inclusion criteria for the database included studies published from 1946 to 2016, peer-reviewed international literature, and studies focused on RNs in all health-care disciplines, settings, and sectors. Masters-prepared nurse researchers conducted title and abstract screening and relevance review to determine eligibility of studies for the database. High-level analysis was conducted to determine key outcomes and the frequency at which they appeared within the database. RESULTS: Of the initial 90,352 records, a total of 626 abstracts were included within the database. Studies were organized into three groups corresponding to clinical and patient outcomes, organizational and nurse-related outcomes, and financial outcomes. Organizational and nurse-related outcomes represented the largest category in the database with 282 studies, followed by clinical and patient outcomes with 244 studies, and lastly financial outcomes, which included 124 studies.

BACKGROUND: Migraine affects over 12% of adults in Western countries and an estimated 36 million people in the United States. Triptans are an abortive treatment option in patients with moderate to severe migraine. Despite the safety and efficacy of triptans reported in clinical trials, observational studies have consistently demonstrated low persistence to therapy and frequent switching among products over time. METHODS: The following databases were researched: Medline, CENTRAL, and EMBASE. Detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria were specified a priori before conducting abstract and full-text screening. Included studies were required to: (1) report triptan use for migraine treatment; (2) report measures of persistence and/or switching patterns; (3) study migraineurs aged 18 years or older; and (4) conduct an observational study. Studies were excluded if they (1) incorporated interventional study design; (2) lack information or relevance to outcome of interest; (3) were not original research; (4) did not clearly state the results; and (5) were not written in English. Abstracts and full-text articles were reviewed independently by two investigators. RESULTS: Out of 595 studies identified, 380 studies were included for abstract screening. A total of 12 articles met the eligibility criteria after full-text screening of 44 studies, including four studies from reference search. The proportion of patients that remained persistent up to six refills of an index triptan ranged from 3.2% to 12.6% and the proportion of patients that never refilled their index triptan ranged from 38% to 65.8%. In addition to those patients who discontinued, several studies reported that 5-9% of newly initiating triptan users switch to a different triptan before refilling their original medication. Finally, several studies reported the 1-year probability of discontinuation among a general group of triptan users (not limited to treatment naive patients) to be between 30% and 60%. CONCLUSIONS: Triptans can be a valuable option for acute treatment of migraine. However, studies have shown that treatment persistence is low. This, along with frequent switching behaviors, suggests that a significant unmet clinical need remains despite the wide availability of triptans.','Messali AJ and Yang M and Gillard P and Tsai K and Tepper SJ and Bloudek LM and Kori SH','Headache',NULL,'Humans,Migraine Disorders/*drug therapy,Tryptamines/*therapeutic use'),(390,2,'24484516','24484516','Contemporary undergraduate implant dentistry education: a systematic review.','INTRODUCTION: Consensus reports recommend that students upon graduation should possess a significant level of knowledge and competence in implant dentistry, including basic competences in diagnostics, treatment planning, restorative, straightforward surgical and maintenance procedures. In response, undergraduate curricula need to integrate implant dentistry. This narrative review explores educational programmes in terms of competences, related research and barriers or reflections, regarding implementation in undergraduate curricula. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Publications (2008-2013) were searched systematically in WoS, PubMed and ERIC and screened independently by two authors in four stages: removal of duplicates, title screening, abstract screening and full-text reading. Inclusion criteria encompassed implant dentistry in undergraduate education. RESULTS: Finally, 37 of 420 papers were included. Detailed information regarding programme content, number of participants, staff input, logistics/funding issues is scattered. Theoretical education is predominant, and pre-clinical/clinical training is offered minimally, often carried out in elective programmes. However, selected straightforward cases treated by undergraduates yield positive outcomes with low failure rates, few complications, high patient satisfaction and student appreciation. Barriers to implementing implant dentistry in the undergraduate curriculum include funding issues, limitations in time or staff availability/competence and lack of suitable patients. Overcoming these barriers is worthwhile as experience-based implant education affects future practice as well-informed students propose more restorative alternatives to their patients. CONCLUSION: Although implant dentistry is increasingly integrated in undergraduate curricula, challenges remain in developing strategies to implement existing competence profiles and the extent of experience-based education. To support further advancement, universities should report comprehensively on their implant programmes to allow comparison and reproduction in other environments.','Koole S and De Bruyn H','European journal of dental education : official journal of the Association for Dental Education in Europe',NULL,'Clinical Competence,Curriculum,Dental Implantation/*education,Education, Dental/*organization & administration,Humans'),(391,2,'30864982','30864982','Out-of-pocket expenses related to aging in place for frail older people: a scoping review protocol.','OBJECTIVE: The objective of this scoping review is to describe the available evidence reporting out-of-pocket expenses for aging-in-place for frail older people and their caregivers. INTRODUCTION: There has been an increased focus on supporting frail older people to live in the community, rather than in costly long-term residential care. The out-of-pocket expenses associated with supporting older people with frailty to remain in their homes and communities contribute to caregiver burden and can influence decisions about where to live. INCLUSION CRITERIA: This scoping review will consider literature on community-dwelling older people 60 years and older who have been identified as frail. Research and policy papers that report the out-of-pocket expenses incurred by older people with frailty or by their family or friend caregivers to support aging well at home will be included. Studies in English will be considered with no date restriction. METHODS: The search strategy aims to find both published and unpublished literature (e.g. policy papers, theses and dissertations). Search databases include CINAHL, PubMed, Scopus, Embase, PsycINFO, Sociological Abstracts, and Public Affairs Index, as well as databases of unpublished sources. The language will be limited to English or French. Title and abstract screening, as well as full-text screening, will be completed by two reviewers.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: An electronic search was conducted on Medline/PubMed and Cochrane databases in February 2019; irrespective of any time restrictions using MeSH terms. All studies were first reviewed by abstract and subsequently by full-text reading. Further hand search was performed to identify other related references. Articles only related to cement-retained and/or screw-retained reconstructions in full-arch fixed dental prostheses (FDP) were included. RESULTS: The initial literature search resulted in 3670 papers. 3478 articles remained after removing duplicate articles, and 3439 articles were further excluded by the reviewers after the abstract screening, which resulted in a selection of 39 studies. 12 studies were further excluded due to not fulfilling the inclusion criteria. Hand searching resulted in two additional papers being included, and finally, 29 articles were included in this review. Screw-retained full-arch fixed dental prostheses have fewer complications than cemented reconstructions. Biological complications such as marginal bone loss > 2 mm occurred more frequently in cemented reconstructions, and technical complications such as screw-loosening and screw fracture occurred more in screw-retained reconstructions. CONCLUSION: Cemented reconstructions exhibited more biological complications (implant loss, bone loss > 2 mm) and screw-retained prostheses exhibited more technical problems. Clinical outcomes were influenced by both fixations in different ways. The screw-retained restorations were more easily retrievable than cemented ones, therefore, technical and eventually biological complications could be treated more easily. For this reason, and for their higher biological compatibility, these reconstructions are preferable.','Gaddale R and Mishra SK and Chowdhary R','International journal of oral implantology (Berlin, Germany)',NULL,'Bone Screws,Cementation,*Dental Implants,*Dental Prosthesis Retention,Dental Prosthesis, Implant-Supported,Dental Restoration Failure'),(394,2,'32626472','32626472','Assessment of the endocrine disrupting properties of Bisphenol AF according to the EU criteria and ECHA/EFSA guidance.','Endocrine disruptors (EDs) are exogenous compounds that interfere with the hormone system, affecting human health and environment. Specific legislative obligations have been introduced in the European Union (EU) to gradually eliminate EDs in water, industrial chemicals and pesticides. However, identification of EDs is the first and essential step towards regulation and appropriate risk management. Scientific criteria and guidance for ED assessment have recently been established for pesticides in the EU. In this project, the ED properties of the non-pesticide chemical Bisphenol AF (BPAF), analogue and potential substitute of Bisphenol A were evaluated by the application of the EU criteria and guidance in the frame of human health risk assessment. A data dossier was built by a systematic literature review (WOS, Scopus, Pubmed, Embase), title/abstract screening (RAYYAN) and full-text examination. All relevant information was extracted and systematically reported, and reliability and relevance of data were assessed (SciRAP). Data were synthesised into lines of evidence for (i) endocrine activity, (ii) adversity and (iii) general toxicity, and weight of evidence evaluation was applied. The initial analysis of the evidence showed potential endocrine adverse effects and endocrine activity, meeting the ED criteria and leading the assessment to the mode of action (MoA) analysis. The biological plausibility of the link between the adverse effects and the endocrine activity was investigated based on current scientific knowledge. Empirical support for dose-response and temporal concordance was evaluated, and the key events were assessed in terms of essentiality, consistency, analogy and specificity. Finally, an overall conclusion of the ED properties of BPAF was drawn. The EU criteria and guidance for EDs assessment were successfully applied to BPAF demonstrating its endocrine activity and adversity based on weight of evidence methodology and MoA analysis. The Fellow greatly increased her knowledge and hands-on experience on ED assessment in the EU regulatory context contributing to implement transparency and structure in health risk assessment.','Escriva L and Hanberg A and Zilliacus J and Beronius A','EFSA journal.

To the best of our knowledge, no systematic reviews have previously reported the bone regenerative effect of the HA bone substitute. Materials and methods: A literature search was performed for articles published up to August 2015 using MEDLINE with the search terms \"hydroxyapatite,\" \"bone regeneration,\" and \"alveolar bone\" as well as their known synonyms. The inclusion criteria were set up for human trials with at least five patients. The literature search, eligible article selection, and data extraction were independently performed by two readers, and their agreement was reported by kappa value. Results: Of the 504 studies found using the MEDLINE literature search, 241 were included for further steps (inter-reader agreement, kappa = 0.968). Abstract screening yielded 74 studies (kappa = 0.910), with 42 completely fulfilling the inclusion criteria (kappa = 0.864). In a final step, 42 studies were further analyzed, with 17 and 25 studies with and without statistical analysis, respectively. The 17 studies reporting similar outcome measures were compared using the calculated 95% confidence intervals. The effect of HA on ridge preservation could not be evaluated. Conclusions: The use of the HA bone substitute interfered with the normal healing process, with significant differences found for sinus augmentation but not for periodontal bone defects. Thus, a bone substitute with optimal bone regenerative properties for alveolar ridge or socket preservation, sinus augmentation, and periodontal bony defect should be developed.','Dewi AH and Ana ID','Heliyon',NULL,''),(396,2,'31272125','31272125','The value of a second reviewer for study selection in systematic reviews.','BACKGROUND: Although dual independent review of search results by two reviewers is generally recommended for systematic reviews, there are not consistent recommendations regarding the timing of the use of the second reviewer. This study compared the use of a complete dual review approach, with two reviewers in both the title/abstract screening stage and the full-text screening stage, as compared with a limited dual review approach, with two reviewers only in the full-text stage. METHODS: This study was performed within the context of a large systematic review. Two reviewers performed a complete dual review of 15 000 search results and a limited dual review of 15 000 search results. The number of relevant studies mistakenly excluded by highly experienced reviewers in the complete dual review was compared with the number mistakenly excluded during the full-text stage of the limited dual review. RESULTS: In the complete dual review approach, an additional 6.6% to 9.1% of eligible studies were identified during the title/abstract stage by using two reviewers, and an additional 6.6% to 11.9% of eligible studies were identified during the full-text stage by using two reviewers. In the limited dual review approach, an additional 4.4% to 5.3% of eligible studies were identified with the use of two reviewers. CONCLUSIONS: Using a second reviewer throughout the entire study screening process can increase the number of relevant studies identified for use in a systematic review.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: PubMed and EMBASE were searched from July 2007. Title/abstract screening, full text review, and critical appraisal were undertaken by 2 reviewers, whereas data extraction was performed by a single reviewer. Eligible articles had to provide a summary measure of accuracy and undertake internal or external validation. Tools were recommended for clinical implementation if they had been externally validated and found to have accuracy >/=70%. RESULTS: The search strategy identified 3839 potential studies, of which 236 progressed to full text review and 22 were included. From these studies, 50 tools predicted gastrointestinal/rectal symptoms, 29 tools predicted genitourinary symptoms, 4 tools predicted erectile dysfunction, and no tools predicted quality of life. For patients treated with external beam radiation therapy, 3 tools could be recommended for the prediction of rectal toxicity, gastrointestinal toxicity, and erectile dysfunction. For patients treated with brachytherapy, 2 tools could be recommended for the prediction of urinary retention and erectile dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: A large number of tools for the prediction of PROMs in prostate cancer patients treated with radiation therapy have been developed.

However, significant variability in scoping review conduct and reporting currently exists, limiting potential for the methodology to advance rehabilitation research, practice and policy. Our aim is to conduct a scoping review of rehabilitation scoping reviews in order to examine the current volume, yearly distribution, proportion, scope and methodological practices involved in the conduct of scoping reviews in rehabilitation. Key areas of methodological improvement will be described. Methods and analysis: We will undertake the review using the Arksey and O\'Malley scoping review methodology.

Screening titles and abstracts (T&Ab) for inclusion in a systematic review is an intensive, and often collaborative, step. The use of appropriate tools is therefore important. In this study, we identified and evaluated the usability of software tools that support T&Ab screening for systematic reviews within healthcare research. METHODS: We identified software tools using three search methods: a web-based search; a search of the online \"systematic review toolbox\"; and screening of references in existing literature. We included tools that were accessible and available for testing at the time of the study (December 2018), do not require specific computing infrastructure and provide basic screening functionality for systematic reviews. Key properties of each software tool were identified using a feature analysis adapted for this purpose. This analysis included a weighting developed by a group of medical researchers, therefore prioritising the most relevant features. The highest scoring tools from the feature analysis were then included in a user survey, in which we further investigated the suitability of the tools for supporting T&Ab screening amongst systematic reviewers working in medical research. RESULTS: Fifteen tools met our inclusion criteria. They vary significantly in relation to cost, scope and intended user community. Six of the identified tools (Abstrackr, Colandr, Covidence, DRAGON, EPPI-Reviewer and Rayyan) scored higher than 75% in the feature analysis and were included in the user survey. Of these, Covidence and Rayyan were the most popular with the survey respondents. Their usability scored highly across a range of metrics, with all surveyed researchers (n = 6) stating that they would be likely (or very likely) to use these tools in the future. CONCLUSIONS: Based on this study, we would recommend Covidence and Rayyan to systematic reviewers looking for suitable and easy to use tools to support T&Ab screening within healthcare research. These two tools consistently demonstrated good alignment with user requirements. We acknowledge, however, the role of some of the other tools we considered in providing more specialist features that may be of great importance to many researchers.','Harrison H and Griffin SJ and Kuhn I and Usher-Smith JA','BMC medical research methodology',NULL,''),(402,2,'28751485','28751485','Herbal medications for surgical patients: a systematic review protocol.','INTRODUCTION: Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) affect approximately 80% of surgical patients and is associated with increased length of hospital stay and systemic costs. Preoperative and postoperative pain, anxiety and depression are also commonly reported. Recent evidence regarding their safety and effectiveness has not been synthesised. The aim of this systematic review is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of herbal medications for the treatment and prevention of anxiety, depression, pain and PONV in patients undergoing laparoscopic, obstetrical/gynaecological and cardiovascular surgical procedures. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The following electronic databases will be searched up to 1 October 2016 without language or publication status restrictions: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science and LILACS. Randomised clinical trials enrolling adult surgical patients undergoing laparoscopic, obstetrical/gynaecological and cardiovascular surgeries and managed with herbal medication versus a control group (placebo, no intervention or active control) prophylactically or therapeutically will be considered eligible. Outcomes of interest will include the following: anxiety, depression, pain, nausea and vomiting. A team of reviewers will complete title and abstract screening and full-text screening for identified hits independently and in duplicate. Data extraction, risk of bias assessments and evaluation of the overall quality of evidence for each relevant outcome reported will be conducted independently and in duplicate using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment Development and Evaluation classification system. Dichotomous data will be summarised as risk ratios; continuous data will be summarised as standard average differences with 95% CIs.

Non-pharmacological interventions are an appealing alternative for the treatment of BPSD in patients with dementia. Simulated presence therapy (SPT) is a simple and inexpensive non-pharmacological intervention that can be used to treat BPSD. We propose a Cochrane protocol for the collection and assessment of evidence concerning the efficacy of SPT to treat relevant outcomes in people with dementia. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will search the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group\'s Specialised Register MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, LILACS, CENTRAL and a number of trial registers as well as grey literature sources. We will include randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials (including cross-over studies) that evaluated SPT in people with dementia. Comparators such as usual care with no additional activity, or any activity that differs in content and approach from SPT, but is additional to usual care, will be considered. The primary outcomes of interest will comprise behavioural and psychological symptoms, as measured by relevant scales, and quality of life. Two review authors working independently and in tandem will be involved in title and abstract screening, full-text screening and data abstraction. Where possible, quantitative data will be pooled, and relative risk and mean difference with 95% CI will be employed for dichotomous and continuous data, respectively. Assessment of risk of bias will be performed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool and the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach.

The understanding of the link between IPV and HIV is currently inconclusive and information concerning the IPV experiences of HIV-infected women is insufficient. This protocol aims to map evidence of IPV against women living with HIV/AIDS in Africa. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will search and review peer-reviewed and review articles. The comprehensive search will include the electronic databases PubMed, MEDLINE with full text via EBSCO host, Google Scholar, Science Direct and Scopus. The advanced search will use MeSH terms. Grey literature will also be included. The titles of the studies from the database searches will be screened, and duplicates will be removed. The abstract screening will be done independently by two reviewers, followed by the full-text screening which will be based on the eligibility criteria. The six methodological stages in this review will be to: identify the research questions; identify relevant studies; select the studies; chart the data; collate, summarise and report the results; and thereafter undertake consultations. The quality of studies included in the review will be determined by the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool.

SOURCES: PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Scopus, LILACS, BBO, ClinicalTrials.gov and SiGLE were searched without restrictions. STUDY SELECTION: We included randomized clinical trials (RCTs) that compared the clinical performance of direct and indirect resin composite restorations in Class I and Class II cavities in permanent teeth, with at least two years of follow-up. The risk of bias tool suggested by Cochrane Collaboration was used for quality assessment. DATA: After duplicate removal, 912 studies were identified. Twenty fulfilled the inclusion criteria after the abstract screening. Two articles were added after a hand search of the reference list of included studies. After examination, nine RCTs were included in the qualitative analysis and five were considered to have a \'low\' risk of bias. The overall risk difference in longevity between direct and indirect resin composite restorations in permanent posterior teeth (p>0.05) at five-year follow-up was 1.494 [0.893-2.500], and regardless of the type of tooth restored, that of molar and premolars was 0.716 [0.177-2.888] at three-year follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the findings, there was no difference in longevity of direct and indirect resin composite restorations regardless of the type of material and the restored tooth. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Contemporary dentistry is based on minimally invasive restorations. Any indication of a less conservative technique must have unquestionable advantages. In vitro and in vivo studies reveal contradictory evidence of the clinical performance of direct and indirect resin composite restorations in posterior teeth.

METHODS: On the basis of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (the PRISMA statement) we performed this systematic review and meta-analysis. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, CNKI, CBM, and WanFang Data using medical subject headings (MeSH) and text words. Title/abstract screening, full text check, data extraction, and methodological quality assessment (with the QUADAS-2 tool) were performed by 2 reviewers independently. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio (PLR), negative likelihood ratio (NLR), diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), the summary receiver operator characteristic curve, and the area under the curve (AUC) were analyzed with Meta-DiSc software. Statistical heterogeneity was evaluated by Cochran\'s Q test and I, meta-regression was conducted based on patient type, and the possibility of publication bias was evaluated using Deeks funnel plot in Stata software. RESULTS: Of 293 publications, nine met our inclusion criteria. These studies included a total of 2730 patients and 567 cervical intraepithelial neoplasias. The pooled test characteristics for the TruScreen were as follows: sensitivity 76% (95% CI, 73-80%), specificity 69% (95% CI, 67%-71%), PLR 2.30 (95% CI, 1.59-3.33), and NLR 0.34 (95% CI, 0.23-0.51).

DESIGN: Scoping review of the international published and grey literature. DATA SOURCES: The search included electronic databases, international professional and governmental websites, contact with experts, and hand searches of reference lists. Eligible papers had to (a) address caseload or patient panels for nurse practitioners in community-based primary health care settings serving an all-ages population; and (b) be published in English or French between January 2000 and July 2014. Level one testing included title and abstract screening by two team members. Relevant papers were retained for full text review in level two testing, and reviewed by two team members. A third reviewer acted as a tiebreaker. Data were extracted using a structured extraction form by one team member and verified by a second member. Descriptive statistics were estimated. Content analysis was used for qualitative data. RESULTS: We identified 111 peer-reviewed articles and grey literature documents. Most of the papers were published in Canada and the United States after 2010. Current methods to determine panel/caseload size use large administrative databases, provider work hours and the average number of patient visits. Most of the papers addressing the topic of patient panel/caseload size in community-based primary health care were descriptive. The average number of patients seen by nurse practitioners per day varied considerably within and between countries; an average of 9-15 patients per day was common. Patient characteristics (e.g., age, gender) and health conditions (e.g., multiple chronic conditions) appear to influence patient panel/caseload size. Very few studies used validated tools to classify patient acuity levels or disease burden scores. DISCUSSION: The measurement of productivity and the determination of panel/caseload size is complex. Current metrics may not capture activities relevant to community-based primary health care nurse practitioners. Tools to measure all the components of these role are needed when determining panel/caseload size. Outcomes research is absent in the determination of panel/caseload size. CONCLUSION: There are few systems in place to track and measure community-based primary health care nurse practitioner activities. The development of such mechanisms is an important next step to assess community-based primary health care nurse practitioner productivity and determine patient panel/caseload size.

A search of Medline (OVID), The Cochrane Library (Wiley) and EMBASE, PubMed and Health technology assessment (HTA) organisations as-well as a complementary hand-search was carried out. Selected primary studies were assessed using GRADE. Each study was reviewed by three authors independently.Results: Abstract screening yielded six potential systematic reviews allocated for full-text inspection. A total of ten primary studies were read in full-text. No relevant systematic reviews regarding the topic of this article were found. The quality assessment resulted in two primary studies with a moderate risk of bias. Of the two studies with a moderate risk of bias, one compared a single dose of clindamycin 600 mg preoperatively with the same preoperative dose followed by four doses of 300 mg every 6 h. The second study compared a single dose prophylaxis of two different types of antibiotic compounds.Conclusion: In conclusion, the scientific evidence regarding the use of antibiotic prophylaxis for reducing the risk of infection in conjunction with bone augmentation procedures during dental implant placement is very limited. The infection rate as compared to nonusage of prophylactic antibiotics, selection of the most suitable compound, and the optimal duration of prophylactic treatment is still unknown.','Klinge A and Khalil D and Klinge B and Lund B and Naimi-Akbar A and Tranaeus S and Hultin M','Acta odontologica Scandinavica',NULL,'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*therapeutic use,*Antibiotic Prophylaxis,*Bone Transplantation,*Dental Implants,Humans,Postoperative Complications/prevention & control,Systematic Reviews as Topic'),(409,2,'32188467','32188467','Health systems influence on the pathways of care for lung cancer in low- and middle-income countries: a scoping review.','BACKGROUND: Globally, lung cancer is the most common cancer and cause of cancer-related deaths, responsible for nearly one in five deaths. Many health systems in low- and middle-income countries, including sub-Saharan Africa have weak organizational structure, which results in delayed lead time for lung cancer patient care continuum from diagnosis to palliative care. AIM: To map evidence on the health systems issues impacting on the delays in timely lung cancer care continuum from diagnosis to palliative care in LMICs, including sub-Saharan Africa. METHODS: A scoping review was performed following the method of Arksey and O\'Malley. Systematic searches were performed using EBSCOhost platform, a keyword search from the following electronic databases were conducted: PubMed/MEDLINE, Google Scholar, Science Direct, World Health Organization (WHO) library, and grey literature. The screening was guided by the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The quality of the included studies was determined by Mixed Method Appraisal Tool (MMAT). RESULTS: A total of 2886 articles were screened, and 236 met the eligibility criteria for this scoping review study. Furthermore, 155 articles were also excluded following abstract screening. Eighty-one articles were selected for full-article screening by two researchers with 10 being selected for independent detailed data extraction for synthesis. These studies were also subjected to methodological quality assessment. All included studies were conducted in LMICs mostly Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America and published between January 2008 and June 2018. The ten included studies described at least one interval in lung cancer care. CONCLUSIONS: Reducing wait time across this care continuum is needed to improve easy access to healthcare, quality care, survival and patient outcomes, as many patients still face longer wait times for diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer than recommended in several healthcare settings. A multidisciplinary team approach will help to reduce wait time and ensure that all patients receive appropriate care. Interventions are needed to address delays in lung cancer care in LMICs. Health-care providers at all levels of care should be educated and equipped with skills to identify lung cancer symptoms and perform or refer for appropriate diagnostic tests.','Nwagbara UI and Ginindza TG and Hlongwana KW','Globalization and health',NULL,''),(410,2,'31211929','31211929','A systematic literature review of the patient hotel model.','Background: The patient hotel model was developed in Northern Europe as a response to increased demand for health and wellbeing services. According to current literature the patient hotel model is a concept of care provision which combines non-acute hospital care with hospitality to afford patients/guests increased satisfaction and security whilst benefitting from evidenced based care. Objective(s): This paper evaluates the concept of the patient hotel model. It presents the findings of a systematic review of existing literature evaluating the benefits such a model can bring to healthcare services and reports on the efficacy in terms of cost to health service providers, and health outcomes to patients/guests. The authors\' aimed to complete a meta-analysis of the data, but were unable to, due to the diversity in the descriptions, service provisions, and client group. Design: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement was used to conduct and report this systematic review. In order to focus the research question, the PICO (Population; Intervention; Comparison and Outcome) framework was used to develop a strategy in literature searching, to ensure systematic rigor. Data sources/review methods: Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, OVID MEDLINE, CINAHL, Embase, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, and Scopus databases were used to search for randomized controlled trials, quasi experimental studies, quantitative and qualitative studies conducted between January 1st 2008 and August 9th, 2018, published in a peer reviewed journal in English or which provided an abstract in English. Citation searches and hand searches were also conducted. Results: 8,693 papers were retrieved and from abstract screening 68 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility by applying an inclusion and exclusion criteria. Seven articles were retained for quality assessment. Methodological rigor was appraised using accepted criteria for the evaluation of research. On appraisal, one systematic review, one Randomized Clinical Trial, two qualitative studies, one quantitative survey, one retrospective analysis of services, and one comparative analysis paper were included for data synthesis. The functionality of the patient hotel model differed across the six countries that reported on them in the included studies, from oncology care, medical care, post-acute rehabilitation and perioperative care. The studies included in this review broadly focused on the themes of patient experience and/or cost, with the intention of informing future service provision. Studies relating to cost efficacy looked at the potential financial savings which could be realized through adopting the patient hotel model. The appraised studies found positive benefits of adopting the patient hotel model, both in terms of cost and patient satisfaction. One study explored the role of nurses in a patient hotel. Conclusions: The lack of consistent definition, diversity in the descriptions, service provisions, and client groups meant that the results could only be systematically reviewed and not synthesized into a meta-analysis. The inconsistencies in labeling and description also have implications for the review process, as studies adopting more abstract classification of the patient hotel model may not have been included in the review. On balance, the appraised evidence appears to suggest that there are positive benefits to patients, nurses and healthcare providers. However further research of greater rigor is needed to provide a better understanding of these outcome measures. Implications for rehabilitation Patient hotels have particular relevance to the field of rehabilitation as they have a strong ethos of promoting self-care and independence, facilitated through greater freedom and family involvement. The patient hotel model has the potential to impact healthcare provision on the global stage, but there is no universal definition, making evidence evaluation difficult. The patient hotel model combines the concepts of health and hospitality and could potentially provide a cost-effective alternative to healthcare, with positive outcomes for patient experience as well as patient health. There is a need to explore new systems of care delivery which provide increased patient satisfaction, and a seamless continuum of care at the acute and primary care interface. This paper examines the patient hotel model of care, and its merits in terms of care provision, patient satisfaction and service efficiency, contributing to the embryonic literature in this field.','Chesterton L and Stephens M and Clark A and Ahmed A','Disability and rehabilitation',NULL,''),(411,2,'31259842','31259842','Experiences and perceptions of spousal/partner caregivers providing care for community-dwelling adults with dementia: a qualitative systematic review.','OBJECTIVE: The objective of this review was to synthesize evidence on the experiences and perceptions of spousal/partner caregivers of community-dwelling adults with dementia. INTRODUCTION: Currently 47 million people in the world have a diagnosis of dementia and this number is predicted to climb to 75 million by 2030. The majority of care is provided by family members, particularly spouses/partners. Quantitative systematic reviews of spouse/partner caregivers demonstrate negative health effects for these caregivers. This review synthesized the qualitative evidence on the experiences of spousal/partner caregivers of people with dementia to further understanding how this care and the context of care contribute to the health and wellbeing of spousal/partner caregivers. INCLUSION CRITERIA: This review considered qualitative studies that explored the experiences of spousal/partner caregivers providing care for adults with dementia. The focus was on qualitative designs including, but not limited to, phenomenology, grounded theory, ethnography, action research, critical research and feminist research. METHODS: The search strategy used a three-step approach and was aimed at locating both published and unpublished studies. Key databases included: MEDLINE, CINAHL, Embase, PsycINFO, Sociological Abstracts, ISI Web of Science, and Dissertation Abstracts International. Grey literature was searched using keywords from the database searches. The databases were searched from inception to February 2017 and a mix of controlled vocabulary (i.e. MeSH, CINAHL headings) and keywords were used to capture all existing qualitative studies related to the experiences and perceptions of spousal/partner caregivers providing unpaid care for adults with dementia. During the title and abstract screening, only English and French articles were included. The recommended Joanna Briggs Institute approach to study selection, critical appraisal, data extraction and data synthesis was used. Seven of the 10 critical appraisal criteria were deemed essential, with exceptions identified for criteria 1, 6 and 7. RESULTS: Nineteen studies were included in the review. Study designs included phenomenology (eight), grounded theory (five), qualitative description (four), ethnography (one) and narrative inquiry (one). The total number of participants was 248 (164 women and 84 men). The overall quality of the studies was rated as moderate on the ConQual score, with dependability rated as moderate and credibility rated as high. One hundred and fifty-five findings were aggregated into four categories and two synthesized findings. The two synthesized findings were: \"the expectation to care in the midst of uncertainty and unpredictability\", and \"the caregiver as hostage\". CONCLUSIONS: This review provides a comprehensive understanding that can inform spousal/partner caregiver policies and programs. Evidence is required on the experiences and perceptions of caregivers across the gender continuum. Interventions and interventional research that mobilizes the evidence to date is essential for the future of caregivers. The limitations to this review include: the possibility of missed studies, all study participants being in heterosexual relationships, and the majority of participants being Caucasian. Recommendations for practice, policy and research include: the need for awareness of the extent of change in the lives of the person with dementia and the spousal/partner caregiver, the importance of support and respite, the need to tangibly recognize the value of the unpaid caregiver in a way that preserves the health and wellbeing of this group, and research is required that is culturally sensitive and reflects the experiences of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, transsexual, queer, questioning, intersex, asexual, ally, pansexual (LGBTTQQIAAP) populations.','Macdonald M and Martin-Misener R and Weeks L and Helwig M and Moody E and MacLean H','JBI database of systematic reviews and implementation reports',NULL,''),(412,2,'30170090','30170090','Current State of Urologic Medical School Education: A Scoping Review.','OBJECTIVE: To review current literature pertaining to the availability and implementation of urology-focused curricula, in an effort to highlight current approaches to urologic education at the medical school level. METHODS: A medical librarian searched PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, ERIC, and Scopus for articles focused on undergraduate urology education. Two reviewers adjudicated all retrieved titles. Only those describing interventions in undergraduate medical urology education were included in the review. Data extracted from each article included, but were not limited to: sample size, instructional aim, type of intervention, outcome measurement, significance of results, and strength of evidence.

A search was performed in the MEDLINE database, retrieving a total of 286 articles. After title and abstract screening, the clinical investigations were read in full to select those that evaluated the occlusal aspects of NCCL aetiology. This systematic review describes the results of three prospective and 25 cross-sectional studies. As there is an extreme heterogeneity in design, diagnostic criteria, forms of analysis and associated factors, a meta-analysis was not possible. The wide variety of classification and diagnostic criteria reflects a high range of reported prevalence. An extensive heterogeneity of independent variables was noted, even in occlusal analysis, which helps to mask any conclusion about the role of occlusion in NCCL aetiology. The literature reveals that studies on this topic are subject to a substantial amount of bias, such as evaluation (use of non-blinded examiners) and confounding bias (no control of others aetiological factors). Up to now, it has been impossible to associate NCCLs with any specific causal agent, and the role of occlusion in the pathogenesis of non-carious cervical lesions seems as yet undetermined.

Such semi-automated screening tools can increase efficiency by reducing the number of abstracts needed to screen or by replacing one screener after adequately training the algorithm of the machine. Savings in workload between 30 percent and 70 percent might be possible with the use of such tools. The goal of our project was to conduct a case study to explore a screening approach that temporarily replaces a human screener with a semi-automated screening tool. METHODS: To address our objective, we evaluated the accuracy of a machine-assisted screening approach using an Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality comparative effectiveness review as the reference standard. We chose DistillerAI as a semi-automated screening tool for our project, applying its naive Bayesian machine-learning option. Five teams screened the same 2,472 abstracts in parallel, using the machine-assisted approach. Each team trained DistillerAI with 300 randomly selected abstracts that the team screened dually. For the remaining 2,172 abstracts, DistillerAI replaced one human screener in each team and provided predictions about the relevance of records. We used a prediction score of 0.5 (i.e., inconclusive) or greater to classify a record as an inclusion. A single reviewer also screened all remaining abstracts. A second human screener resolved conflicts between the single reviewer and DistillerAI. We compared the decisions of the machine-assisted approach, single-reviewer screening (i.e., no machine assistance), and screening with DistillerAI alone (i.e., no human involvement after training) against the reference standard and calculated sensitivities, specificities, and the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve. In addition, we determined the interrater agreement, the proportion of included abstracts, and the number of conflicts between human screeners and DistillerAI. RESULTS: The mean sensitivity of the machine-assisted screening approach across the five screening teams was 78 percent (95% confidence interval [CI], 66% to 90%), and the mean specificity was 95 percent (95% CI, 92% to 97%). By comparison, the sensitivity of single-reviewer screening was also 78 percent (95% CI, 66% to 89%); the sensitivity of DistillerAI alone was 14 percent (95% CI, 0% to 31%). Specificities for single-reviewer screening and DistillerAI alone were 94 percent (95% CI, 91% to 97%) and 98 percent (95% CI, 97% to 100%), respectively. Machine-assisted screening and single-reviewer screening had similar areas under the curve (0.87 and 0.86, respectively); by contrast, the area under the curve for DistillerAI alone was just slightly better than chance (0.56). The interrater agreement between human screeners and DistillerAI with a prevalence-adjusted kappa was 0.85 (95% CI, 0.84 to 0.86). DISCUSSION: Findings of our study indicate that the accuracy of DistillerAI is not yet adequate to replace a human screener temporarily during abstract screening. The approach that we tested missed too many relevant studies and created too many conflicts between human screeners and DistillerAI. Rapid reviews, which do not require detecting the totality of the relevant evidence, may find semi-automation tools to have greater utility than traditional systematic reviews.','Gartlehner G and Wagner G and Lux L and Affengruber L and Dobrescu A and Kaminski-Hartenthaler A and Viswanathan M','',NULL,''),(417,2,'25333995','25333995','Patient-reported outcome (PRO) assessment in clinical trials: a systematic review of guidance for trial protocol writers.','BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests there are inconsistencies in patient-reported outcome (PRO) assessment and reporting in clinical trials, which may limit the use of these data to inform patient care. For trials with a PRO endpoint, routine inclusion of key PRO information in the protocol may help improve trial conduct and the reporting and appraisal of PRO results; however, it is currently unclear exactly what PRO-specific information should be included. The aim of this review was to summarize the current PRO-specific guidance for clinical trial protocol developers. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We searched the MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINHAL and Cochrane Library databases (inception to February 2013) for PRO-specific guidance regarding trial protocol development. Further guidance documents were identified via Google, Google scholar, requests to members of the UK Clinical Research Collaboration registered clinical trials units and international experts. Two independent investigators undertook title/abstract screening, full text review and data extraction, with a third involved in the event of disagreement. 21,175 citations were screened and 54 met the inclusion criteria. Guidance documents were difficult to access: electronic database searches identified just 8 documents, with the remaining 46 sourced elsewhere (5 from citation tracking, 27 from hand searching, 7 from the grey literature review and 7 from experts). 162 unique PRO-specific protocol recommendations were extracted from included documents. A further 10 PRO recommendations were identified relating to supporting trial documentation. Only 5/162 (3%) recommendations appeared in >/=50% of guidance documents reviewed, indicating a lack of consistency. CONCLUSIONS: PRO-specific protocol guidelines were difficult to access, lacked consistency and may be challenging to implement in practice. There is a need to develop easily accessible consensus-driven PRO protocol guidance. Guidance should be aimed at ensuring key PRO information is routinely included in appropriate trial protocols, in order to facilitate rigorous collection/reporting of PRO data, to effectively inform patient care.','Calvert M and Kyte D and Duffy H and Gheorghe A and Mercieca-Bebber R and Ives J and Draper H and Brundage M and Blazeby J and King M','PloS one',NULL,'Clinical Protocols/standards,*Clinical Trials as Topic,Humans,*Patient Outcome Assessment,Research Design,*Self Report,Systematic Reviews as Topic'),(418,2,'29137659','29137659','The effectiveness of research implementation strategies for promoting evidence-informed policy and management decisions in healthcare: a systematic review.','BACKGROUND: It is widely acknowledged that health policy and management decisions rarely reflect research evidence. Therefore, it is important to determine how to improve evidence-informed decision-making. The primary aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the effectiveness of research implementation strategies for promoting evidence-informed policy and management decisions in healthcare. The secondary aim of the review was to describe factors perceived to be associated with effective strategies and the inter-relationship between these factors. METHODS: An electronic search was developed to identify studies published between January 01, 2000, and February 02, 2016. This was supplemented by checking the reference list of included articles, systematic reviews, and hand-searching publication lists from prominent authors. Two reviewers independently screened studies for inclusion, assessed methodological quality, and extracted data. RESULTS: After duplicate removal, the search strategy identified 3830 titles. Following title and abstract screening, 96 full-text articles were reviewed, of which 19 studies (21 articles) met all inclusion criteria. Three studies were included in the narrative synthesis, finding policy briefs including expert opinion might affect intended actions, and intentions persisting to actions for public health policy in developing nations. Workshops, ongoing technical assistance, and distribution of instructional digital materials may improve knowledge and skills around evidence-informed decision-making in US public health departments. Tailored, targeted messages were more effective in increasing public health policies and programs in Canadian public health departments compared to messages and a knowledge broker. Sixteen studies (18 articles) were included in the thematic synthesis, leading to a conceptualisation of inter-relating factors perceived to be associated with effective research implementation strategies. A unidirectional, hierarchal flow was described from (1) establishing an imperative for practice change, (2) building trust between implementation stakeholders and (3) developing a shared vision, to (4) actioning change mechanisms. This was underpinned by the (5) employment of effective communication strategies and (6) provision of resources to support change. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence is developing to support the use of research implementation strategies for promoting evidence-informed policy and management decisions in healthcare. The design of future implementation strategies should be based on the inter-relating factors perceived to be associated with effective strategies.

Current standard treatment consists of calcium and vitamin D supplementation. The intake of calcium and vitamin D supplementation can lead to complications and therefore might negatively influence patients\' quality of life. METHODS: A systematic literature review was performed to assess the current knowledge on the influence of hypoparathyroidism on patients\' quality of life. The literature search was conducted in PubMed and Web of Science; all relevant literature published by August 24, 2016, was included. RESULTS: In total 372 records were found. After title and abstract screening, 14 studies remained for a full-text screening. The full-text screening resulted in five studies which were included into the systematic review. Comparing the results with a norm-based reference population, three studies reported lower SF-36 scores for hypoparathyroidism patients. Two studies showed a reduced quality of life in hypoparathyroidism patients when their results were compared to control populations. CONCLUSION: Most hypoparathyroidism patients receiving standard treatment show stable calcium and vitamin D levels. However, hypoparathyroidism patients still report reduced quality of life and experience physical, mental, and emotional symptoms. Therefore, it is assumed that the lack of parathyroid hormone directly influences the patients\' quality of life. This review indicates that patients with hypoparathyroidism have a reduced quality of life in comparison to norm-based populations or matched controls. Further studies are required to quantify the effect of hypoparathyroidism on patients\' quality of life using disease-specific questionnaires and controlling for the co-morbidities and etiologies of the patients.','Buttner M and Musholt TJ and Singer S','Endocrine',NULL,'Hormone Replacement Therapy,Humans,Hypoparathyroidism/drug therapy/*psychology/*therapy,*Quality of Life'),(421,2,'32311103','32311103','Quality appraisal of economic evaluations done on oral health preventive programs-A systematic review.','OBJECTIVES: If economic evaluations are to be used by decision makers, such evidence has to be robust so that the relevant policy maker use them.

Therefore, every scientist and institution must carefully maintain and update records of their scientific publications. However, in most institutions and universities articles are often managed in a redundant file-based and non-central way. Whereas excellent reference management software packages such as Zotero, Endnote or Mendeley exist to manage bibliographies and references when writing scientific articles, we are not aware of any open source database solution keeping track of publication records from large scientific groups, entire institutions and/or universities. RESULTS: We here describe LitDB, a novel open source literature database solution for easy maintenance of publication lists assigned to various topics. In the last 2 years more than 50 users have been using LitDB at our research institute. The LitDB system is accessed via a web browser. Publications can be uploaded through direct exports from reference manager libraries or by entering PubMed IDs. Single users or user groups can track their citation counts, h-index and impact factor statistics and gain insights into the publication records of other users. It offers various visualization functions like coauthor networks and provides ways to organize publications from dedicated projects and user groups. The latter is in particular beneficial to manage publication lists of large research groups and research initiatives through a \"crowd-sourcing\" effort. CONCLUSIONS: Keeping track of papers authored and published by a research group, institute or university is an important and non-trivial task. By using a centralized web-based platform for publication management such as LitDB the compilation of project- and group-related publication lists becomes easily manageable and it is less likely that papers are forgotten along the way.','Bethune J and Kraemer L and Thomsen I and Keller A and Ellinghaus D and Franke A','Source code for biology and medicine',NULL,''),(423,2,'30241739','30241739','Bone grafting in orthognathic surgery: a systematic review.','Bone grafting has been used in orthognathic surgery to fill the gaps created by jaw repositioning, with the intention of improving healing and stability.

For tackling this public health problem, preventive public health and policy actions are urgently needed. Some countries implemented food taxes in the past and some were subsequently abolished. Some countries, such as Norway, Hungary, Denmark, Bermuda, Dominica, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and the Navajo Nation (USA), specifically implemented taxes on unprocessed sugar and sugar-added foods. These taxes on unprocessed sugar and sugar-added foods are fiscal policy interventions, implemented to decrease their consumption and in turn reduce adverse health-related, economic and social effects associated with these food products. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of taxation of unprocessed sugar or sugar-added foods in the general population on the consumption of unprocessed sugar or sugar-added foods, the prevalence and incidence of overweight and obesity, and the prevalence and incidence of other diet-related health outcomes. SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, MEDLINE, Embase and 15 other databases and trials registers on 12 September 2019. We handsearched the reference list of all records of included studies, searched websites of international organisations and institutions, and contacted review advisory group members to identify planned, ongoing or unpublished studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included studies with the following populations: children (0 to 17 years) and adults (18 years or older) from any country and setting. Exclusion applied to studies with specific subgroups, such as people with any disease who were overweight or obese as a side-effect of the disease. The review included studies with taxes on or artificial increases of selling prices for unprocessed sugar or food products that contain added sugar (e.g. sweets, ice cream, confectionery, and bakery products), or both, as intervention, regardless of the taxation level or price increase. In line with Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) criteria, we included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster-randomised controlled trials (cRCTs), non-randomised controlled trials (nRCTs), controlled before-after (CBA) studies, and interrupted time series (ITS) studies. We included controlled studies with more than one intervention or control site and ITS studies with a clearly defined intervention time and at least three data points before and three after the intervention. Our primary outcomes were consumption of unprocessed sugar or sugar-added foods, energy intake, overweight, and obesity. Our secondary outcomes were substitution and diet, expenditure, demand, and other health outcomes. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently screened all eligible records for inclusion, assessed the risk of bias, and performed data extraction.Two review authors independently assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. MAIN RESULTS: We retrieved a total of 24,454 records. After deduplicating records, 18,767 records remained for title and abstract screening. Of 11 potentially relevant studies, we included one ITS study with 40,210 household-level observations from the Hungarian Household Budget and Living Conditions Survey. The baseline ranged from January 2008 to August 2011, the intervention was implemented on September 2011, and follow-up was until December 2012 (16 months). The intervention was a tax - the so-called \'Hungarian public health product tax\' - on sugar-added foods, including selected foods exceeding a specific sugar threshold value. The intervention includes co-interventions: the taxation of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) and of foods high in salt or caffeine. The study provides evidence on the effect of taxing foods exceeding a specific sugar threshold value on the consumption of sugar-added foods. After implementation of the Hungarian public health product tax, the mean consumption of taxed sugar-added foods (measured in units of kg) decreased by 4.0% (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.040, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.07 to -0.01; very low-certainty evidence). The study was at low risk of bias in terms of performance bias, detection bias and reporting bias, with the shape of effect pre-specified and the intervention unlikely to have any effect on data collection. The study was at unclear risk of attrition bias and at high risk in terms of other bias and the independence of the intervention. We rated the certainty of the evidence as very low for the primary and secondary outcomes. The Hungarian public health product tax included a tax on sugar-added foods but did not include a tax on unprocessed sugar. We did not find eligible studies reporting on the taxation of unprocessed sugar.

No studies reported on the secondary outcomes of substitution and diet, demand, and other health outcomes. No studies reported on differential effects across population subgroups.

AIM: To discover the major trends in the use of RMS among researchers and Ph.D. students in Tunisia, as a low-income country. METHODS: A hardcopy survey was filled out by researchers and Ph.D. students during an educational seminar at the faculty of medicine of Sfax in 2016 with the aim to collect qualitative data to determine the participants\' knowledge and use of RMS. RESULTS: The survey collected 121 participants, among them, 53.7% know RMS. Mendeley proved to be the best-known software (41.5%), followed by Zotero (35.3%) and Endnote (23%). Training sessions in RMS were taken by 5% of participants. Among the 121 participants, 26.5%of them use RMS., Mendeley was the most used (46.9%), followed by EndNote (28.1%) and Zotero (25%). The most commonly popular feature in RMS is inserting citations (66.9%). Therefore, the analysis, of the reasons behind the choice of RMS proves that the software was used because it is convenient (38.4%), most known (38.4%), easy (30.7%), or suggested by colleagues (30.7%). The free and open-source software was preferred by 81% of the participants. g. However, 50.4% ignore the fact that Zotero is free. Several types and sources of captured citations were unknown by 53.8% and 59% of the rest of the participants. CONCLUSION: The results clearly show that the lack of awareness about RMS in Tunisia is due to the absence of a formal training. As a result, the need for such training is highly important for researchers to be able to benefit from the different advantages of RMS while conducting their academic medical education.','Yangui F and Abouda M and Charfi MR','La Tunisie medicale',NULL,''),(434,2,'27236314','27236314','An LC/ESI-SRM/MS method to screen chemically modified hemoglobin: simultaneous analysis for oxidized, nitrated, lipidated, and glycated sites.','Proteins are continuously exposed to various reactive chemical species (reactive oxygen/nitrogen species, endogenous/exogenous aldehydes/epoxides, etc.) due to physiological and chemical stresses, resulting in various chemical modifications such as oxidation, nitration, glycation/glycoxidation, lipidation/lipoxidation, and adduct formation with drugs/chemicals. Abundant proteins with a long half-life, such as hemoglobin (Hb, t 1/2 63 days, approximately 150 mg/mL), are believed to be major targets of reactive chemical species that reflect biological events.

RESULTS: Out of 44 papers analyzed from 836 papers searched from MEDLINE, 18 different potential risk factors were collected, divided into three categories: three demographics (11 papers), ten clinical factors (31 papers), and five pharmacogenetics/biomarkers (12 papers). Risk factors significant for myopathy and/or rhabdomyolysis included age, gender, diabetes, renal impairment, cardiovascular disease, certain interacting drugs, and mutations of the SLCO1B1 gene, which encodes a transporter protein in the liver. Several factors, such as gender, race, cardiovascular disease, and the GATM gene, which encodes a protein for creatine synthesis, appeared to be protective in terms of the outcomes of interest.

STUDY SELECTION: Parallel group and split mouth randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing stepwise, partial and no dentinal caries removal with complete caries removal in unrestored primary and permanent teeth were included in this review. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Title and abstract screening was by two reviewers, with disagreements resolved by a third. Full texts of eligible studies were assessed by the team until consensus, and data extraction was by three reviewers independently and in triplicate. Two reviewers assessed risk of bias. Trial authors were contacted where possible . RESULTS: Eight trials (all assessed as high risk of bias) with 934 participants and 1372 teeth were included in this updated review (Previously complete or ultraconservative removal of decayed tissue in unfilled teeth, Ricketts, 2006) with four new trials being included. There were a number of different comparisons in the trials (stepwise or partial or no dentinal caries removal compared to complete caries removal) with one study including more than one of these comparisons. Four studies investigated primary teeth, three permanent teeth and one included both.For stepwise caries removal, (four studies), there was a 56% reduction in incidence of pulp exposure (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.60, P < 0.00001) compared to complete caries removal. The mean pulp exposure incidence was 34.7% in the complete caries removal group and 15.4% in the stepwise groups. There was no difference in signs and symptoms of pulp disease (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.58, P = 0.50).In the two partial caries removal studies, the incidence of pulp exposure reduction was 77% for the partial caries removal group (RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.69, P = 0.009) with a mean pulp exposure incidence of 21.9% in the complete caries removal groups and 5% in the partial caries removal groups. There was insufficient evidence to determine whether or not there was a difference in signs and symptoms of pulp disease (RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.05 to 1.60, P = 0.15), or restoration failure (one study showing no difference and another study showing no failures in either group).There were two very different studies which looked at no dentinal caries removal compared to complete caries removal. There was some evidence of no difference between these techniques for the outcome of signs and symptoms of pulp disease and reduced risk of restoration failure, favouring no dentinal caries removal, from one study. There were no instances of pulp disease or restoration failure in either group from the second study. Meta-analysis of these two studies was not carried out because of the substantial clinical differences between the studies. CONCLUSIONS: For management of dentinal caries, both stepwise and partial excavation showed clinical advantage over complete caries removal by reducing the incidence of pulp exposure in symptomless, vital, carious primary as well as permanent teeth. The review found no difference in signs or symptoms of pulpal disease between stepwise excavation and complete caries removal.There was insufficient evidence to determine whether there was a difference in signs and symptoms of pulp disease or a difference in the risk of restoration failure with partial caries removal.For the two no dentinal caries removal studies, the one investigating permanent teeth found no difference in restoration failure and the one investigating primary teeth found a statistically significant difference in restoration failure favouring the intervention.Due to the short term follow-up, low reporting of patient centred outcomes and high risk of bias, further high quality, long-term clinical trials are still required to assess the most effective intervention.','Manton D','Evidence-based dentistry',NULL,'Cariostatic Agents/*therapeutic use,Dental Caries/*therapy,*Dental Pulp,*Dentin,Humans,Pit and Fissure Sealants/*therapeutic use'),(437,2,'31246095','31246095','Treatment of ankyloglossia with dental laser in paediatric patients: Scoping review and a case report.','AIM: The two aims of this article were to conduct a scoping review of current knowledge regarding laser treatment of ankyloglossia in children and to report a case of a male paediatric patient with ankyloglossia treated with laser surgery.

Screening could help detect psychological distress early and thus enable timely provision of adequate treatment. The emotion thermometer (ET) is a validated screening tool including five dimensions (distress, anxiety, depression, anger, and need-for-help). Reviewing the literature, we aimed to describe (a) the validity and (b) the application of the ET. METHODS: Six databases were systematically searched for studies using the ET in individuals diagnosed with cancer. Included studies were critically appraised for methodological quality. ET validity and application were narratively synthesized. RESULTS: We identified 580 records eligible for title-abstract screening. Seventeen studies based on 13 different populations were included. Validation studies (5 of 17) concluded that the ET is sensitive to distress detection, delivering prompt and accurate results with no negative impact on clinic visit time. Furthermore, its use is accepted in patients and clinicians. The remaining 12 exploratory studies applied the ET for screening purposes (3 of 12), as outcome measure (6 of 12), or as predictor variable measure (3 of 12). Most studies were conducted in Europe (11 of 17), and 7 of the 12 exploratory studies used the recommended cutoff (greater than or equal to 4). Study populations were mostly female (9 of 13) with a mean age greater than 50 years (12 of 13) at study. CONCLUSIONS: Publications on distress screening with the ET are scarce, especially among young populations. However, research and studies\' recommendations support the ET\'s utility as a valid and feasible tool for distress screening including anxiety and depression and suggest its implementation as part of a structured program for early screening in cancer care.','Harju E and Michel G and Roser K','Psycho-oncology',NULL,'Humans,Mass Screening/*methods,Neoplasms/diagnosis/*psychology,*Psychological Distress,Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic,Reproducibility of Results'),(439,2,'31822284','31822284','How is patient-centred care conceptualized in women\'s health: a scoping review.','BACKGROUND: Gendered disparities in health care delivery and outcomes are an international problem. Patient-centred care (PCC) improves patient and health system outcomes, and is widely advocated to reduce inequities. The purpose of this study was to review published research for frameworks of patient-centred care for women (PCCW) that could serve as the basis for quality improvement. METHODS: A scoping review was conducted by searching MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, SCOPUS, Cochrane Library, and Joanna Briggs index for English-language quantitative or qualitative studies published from 2008 to 2018 that included at least 50% women aged 18 years or greater and employed or generated a PCCW framework. Findings were analyzed using a 6-domain PCC framework, and reported using summary statistics and narrative descriptions. RESULTS: A total of 9267 studies were identified, 6670 were unique, 6610 titles were excluded upon title/abstract screening, and 11 were deemed eligible from among 60 full-text articles reviewed. None were based on or generated a PCCW framework, included solely women, or analyzed or reported findings by gender. All studies explored or described PCC components through qualitative research or surveys. None of the studies addressed all 6 domains of an established PCC framework; however, additional PCC elements emerged in 9 of 11 studies including timely responses, flexible scheduling, and humanized management, meaning tailoring communication and treatment to individual needs and preferences. There were no differences in PCC domains between studies comprised primarily of women and other studies.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy and safety of EMLA in infants <3 months of age requiring venipuncture in comparison with nonpharmacological interventions in terms of pain reduction, change in physiologic variables, and methemoglobinemia. DATA SOURCES: Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Web of Science, and gray literature were searched from inception to August 2017, without language restrictions. STUDY SELECTION: We selected randomized controlled trials in which researchers compared EMLA with nonpharmacological interventions. DATA EXTRACTION: Two reviewers independently performed abstract screening and full-text review, and extracted the data and assessed the risk of bias. RESULTS: Ten randomized controlled trials (907 infants) were included. EMLA revealed little or no effect in reduction of pain (standardized mean difference: 0.14; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.17 to 0.45; 6 trials, n = 742; moderate-quality evidence) when EMLA was compared with sucrose, breastfeeding, or placebo. In comparison with placebo, EMLA revealed a small-to-moderate effect on increasing methemoglobin levels (mean difference: 0.35; 95% CI: 0.04 to 0.66; 2 trials, n = 134; low-quality evidence). There was an increased risk of blanching of the skin in the EMLA group (relative risk: 2.63; 95% CI: 1.58 to 4.38; 2 trials, n = 123; I(2) = 84%, very low-quality evidence). LIMITATIONS: Our results may not be applicable to older infants. CONCLUSIONS: EMLA reveals minimal benefits in terms of reduction of pain due to venipuncture procedure in comparison with placebo and no benefit in comparison with sucrose and/or breastfeeding.

This systematic review aimed to evaluate the evidence for this potential use of NIR systems, establishing their potential as a research tool in this field. Major electronic databases including MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched using pre-planned search strategies with broad scope for any in vivo use of NIR technologies in human bone tissue. Following identification of studies by title and abstract screening, full text inclusion was determined by double blind assessment using predefined criteria. Full text studies for inclusion were data extracted using a predesigned proforma and quality assessed. Narrative synthesis was appropriate given the wide heterogeneity of included studies. Eighty-eight full text studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria, 57 addressing laser Doppler flowmetry (56 intra-operatively), 21 near infrared spectroscopy, and 10 photoplethysmography. The heterogeneity of the methodologies included differing hemodynamic markers, measurement protocols, anatomical locations, and research applications, making meaningful direct comparisons impossible. Further, studies were often limited by small sample sizes with potential selection biases, detection biases, and wide variability in results between participants. Despite promising potential in the use of NIR light to interrogate bone circulation, the application of NIR systems in bone requires rigorous assessment of the reproducibility of potential hemodynamic markers and further validation of these markers against alternative physiologically relevant reference standards.

Histoplasmosis can be diagnosed using culture, histopathology, and antibody, antigen, and molecular assays. Several factors may affect the analytical performance of these laboratory assays, including sample type, clinical stage of the disease, and previous use of antifungal treatment, among others. Here we describe the results of a systematic literature review, followed by a meta-analysis of the analytical performances of the diagnostic laboratory assays employed. Our initial search identified 1631 references, of which 1559 references were excluded after title and abstract screening, leaving 72 references identified as studies relevant to the validation of histoplasmosis diagnostic assays. After evaluating the full text, 30 studies were selected for final review, including one paper not identified in the initial search. The meta-analysis for assay analytical performance shows the following results for the overall sensitivity (Sen) and specificity (Spe) of the various methods evaluated: Culture, Sen 77% (no data for specificity calculation); antibody detection assays, Sen 58%/Spe 100%; antigen detection assays, Sen 95%/Spe 97%; and DNA detection assays (molecular), Sen 95%/Spe 99%. Of the 30 studies reviewed, nearly half (n = 13) evaluated Histoplasma antigen assays, which were determined to be the most accurate methodology for diagnosis of progressive disseminated histoplasmosis in advanced HIV (inverse of the negative likelihood ratio was 13.2). Molecular assays appear promising for accurate diagnosis of histoplasmosis, but consensus on exact techniques is needed. Cultures showed variable sensitivity related to sample type and laboratory handling. Finally, antibody assays presented high specificity but low sensitivity. This poor sensitivity is most likely due the highly immunosuppressed state of this patient population.

The heterogeneity of the syndrome hinders the generation of reproducible numbers on mortality risks. Consequently, mortality rates range from 15 to 56%. We aimed to update and extend the existing knowledge from meta-analyses and estimate 30- and 90-day mortality rates for sepsis and septic shock separately, stratify rates by region and study type and assess mortality rates across different sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores. METHODS: We performed a systematic review of articles published in PubMed or in the Cochrane Database, between 2009 and 2019 in English language including interventional and observational studies. A meta-analysis of pooled 28/30- and 90-day mortality rated separately for sepsis and septic shock was done using a random-effects model. Time trends were assessed via Joinpoint methodology and for the assessment of mortality rate over different SOFA scores, and linear regression was applied. RESULTS: Four thousand five hundred records were identified. After title/abstract screening, 783 articles were assessed in full text for eligibility. Of those, 170 studies were included. Average 30-day septic shock mortality was 34.7% (95% CI 32.6-36.9%), and 90-day septic shock mortality was 38.5% (95% CI 35.4-41.5%). Average 30-day sepsis mortality was 24.4% (95% CI 21.5-27.2%), and 90-day sepsis mortality was 32.2% (95% CI 27.0-37.5%). Estimated mortality rates from RCTs were below prospective and retrospective cohort studies. Rates varied between regions, with 30-day septic shock mortality being 33.7% (95% CI 31.5-35.9) in North America, 32.5% (95% CI 31.7-33.3) in Europe and 26.4% (95% CI 18.1-34.6) in Australia. A statistically significant decrease of 30-day septic shock mortality rate was found between 2009 and 2011, but not after 2011. Per 1-point increase of the average SOFA score, average mortality increased by 1.8-3.3%. CONCLUSION: Trends of lower sepsis and continuous septic shock mortality rates over time and regional disparities indicate a remaining unmet need for improving sepsis management. Further research is needed to investigate how trends in the burden of disease influence mortality rates in sepsis and septic shock at 30- and 90-day mortality over time.','Bauer M and Gerlach H and Vogelmann T and Preissing F and Stiefel J and Adam D','Critical care (London, England)',NULL,''),(447,2,'31441862','31441862','Antiplatelet therapy and coronary artery bypass grafting: Protocol for a systematic review and network meta-analysis.','INTRODUCTION: Saphenous vein graft (SVG) is the most common conduit used for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. Unfortunately, SVG are associated with poor long-term patency rates; a significant predictor of re-operation rates and survival. As such, medical therapy to prevent SVG narrowing or occlusion is of paramount importance. Aspirin (ASA) monotherapy is the standard of care after CABG, to improve long-term major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and graft patency. Benefits of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) have not been well established in all CABG patients. We present a protocol for a network meta-analysis (NMA) comparing the effects of various antiplatelet therapy regimens on SVG patency, mortality, and bleeding among adult patients following CABG. METHODS: We will search CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL ACPJC, and grey literature sources (AHA, ACC, ESC, and CCC conference proceedings, ISRCTN Register, and WHO ICTRP) for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) which fit our criteria. RCTs that evaluate different antiplatelet regimens at least 3-months after CABG and have any of SVG patency, mortality, MACE, and major bleeding as outcomes will be selected. We will perform title and abstract screening, full-text screening, and data extraction independently and in duplicate. Two independent reviewers will also assess risk of bias (ROB) for each study, as well as evaluate quality of evidence using the GRADE framework. We will use R to perform the NMA and use low-dose ASA as reference within our network. We will report results as odds ratios with confidence intervals for direct comparisons, and credible intervals for indirect or mixed comparisons. We will use the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) to estimate the ranking of interventions. DISCUSSION: Given the limited direct comparison of various antiplatelet regimens, a network approach is ideal to clarify the optimum antiplatelet therapy after CABG. We hope that our NMA will be the largest quantitative synthesis evaluating antiplatelet regimens among patients requiring CABG. It should inform clinicians and guideline developers in selecting the most effective and safest antiplatelet regimen.Systematic Review registration: International Prospective Register for Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO)-CRD42019127695.','Gupta S and Belley-Cote EP and Rochwerg B and Bozzo A and Panchal P and Pandey A and Mbuagbaw L and Mehta S and Schwalm JD and Whitlock RP','Medicine',NULL,'Coronary Artery Bypass/*adverse effects/methods/mortality,Coronary Artery Disease/surgery,Humans,Network Meta-Analysis,Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors/*therapeutic use,Saphenous Vein/transplantation,Systematic Reviews as Topic,Treatment Outcome'),(448,2,'30767069','30767069','Different light-activation systems associated with dental bleaching: a systematic review and a network meta-analysis.','OBJECTIVES: A systematic review and a network meta-analysis were performed to answer the following research question: \"Is there any light-activation protocol capable of improving color change efficacy when associated with an in-office bleaching gel in adults?\" MATERIAL AND METHODS: A search was performed in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, LILACS, BBO, Cochrane Library, and SIGLE without date and/or language restrictions in April 23, 2017 (updated on March 30, 2018). IADR abstracts (1990-2018), unpublished and ongoing trial registries, dissertations, and theses were also searched. Only randomized clinical trials conducted in adults that included at least one group treated with in-office dental bleaching with light activation were included. The risk of bias (RoB) was evaluated using the Cochrane Collaboration tool. A random-effects Bayesian-mixed treatment comparison (MTC) model was used to combine light-activated versus light-free in-office bleaching with direct light-free comparison trials. A meta-analysis with independent analysis (high- and low-concentrate hydrogen peroxide [HP]) was conducted for color change (E*, SGU). RESULTS: After the removal of duplicates, title, and abstract screening, 28 studies remained. Nine were considered to be at a low RoB, five were at a high RoB, and the remaining were at an unclear RoB. The MTC analysis showed no significant difference in color change (DeltaE* and DeltaSGU) between light-activation protocols and light-free in-office bleaching, regardless of the HP concentration in the efficacy of the bleaching. CONCLUSION: No type of light-activated in-office bleaching was superior to light-free in-office bleaching for both high- and low-concentrate in-office bleaching gels (PROSPERO-CRD42017078743). CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Although many times dental professionals use \"laser whitening\" as a form of marketing, this study confirmed that no type of light-activation for in-office bleaching can improve the bleaching efficacy.','Maran BM and Ziegelmann PK and Burey A and de Paris Matos T and Loguercio AD and Reis A','Clinical oral investigations',NULL,'Adult,Bayes Theorem,*Dentin Sensitivity,Humans,Hydrogen Peroxide,Male,Network Meta-Analysis,*Tooth Bleaching,*Tooth Bleaching Agents'),(449,2,'30303942','30303942','A Systematic Review on Factors Associated With Percutaneous Bone Anchored Hearing Implants Loss.','OBJECTIVE: To investigate factors associated with percutaneous bone anchored hearing implant (BAHI) loss. DATA SOURCES: Africa-Wide, Biosis, Cochrane, Embase, Global Health, LILACs, Medline, Pubmed, and Web of Science electronic databases. STUDY SELECTION: All studies reporting on adult and/or pediatric patients with a BAHI loss were identified. Retrieved articles were screened using predefined inclusion criteria. Eligible studies underwent critical appraisal for directness of evidence and risk of bias. Studies that successfully passed critical appraisal were included for data extraction. DATA EXTRACTION: Extracted data included study characteristics (study design, number of total implants and implant losses, follow-up), patient characteristics (sex, age, comorbidities, previous therapies), and information regarding BAHI loss (etiology of loss, timing of occurrence). DATA SYNTHESIS: From the 5,151 articles identified at the initial search, 847 remained after title and abstract screening. After full text review, 96 articles were eligible. Fifty-one articles passed quality assessment, however, due to overlapping study population, 48 articles reporting on 34 separate populations were chosen for data extraction. Three hundred one implant losses occurred out of 4,116 implants placed, resulting in an overall implant loss occurrence rate of 7.3%. Failed osseointegration was responsible for most implant losses (74.2%), followed by fixture trauma (25.7%). Most losses due to failed osseointegration occurred within 6 months of the implantation. BAHI implant loss occurred more frequently in pediatric patients (p < 0.005). CONCLUSION: The current systematic review identified factors associated with BAHI loss. These factors should be considered when assessing patients\' candidacy and when investigating reasons for impeded implant stability and loss.','Bezdjian A and Smith RA and Thomeer HGXM and Willie BM and Daniel SJ','Otology & neurotology : official publication of the American Otological Society, American Neurotology Society [and] European Academy of Otology and Neurotology',NULL,'*Equipment Failure,Hearing/physiology,*Hearing Aids,Hearing Tests,Humans,*Osseointegration,*Suture Anchors,Treatment Outcome'),(450,2,'32813376','32813376','Economics of multidisciplinary teams in oncology: a scoping review protocol.','OBJECTIVE: The objective of this scoping review is to summarize the current literature on resource use, costs and economic evaluations of multidisciplinary teams in the field of oncology. INTRODUCTION: Multidisciplinary teams are commonly considered best practice and are in widespread use in the field of oncology. However, multidisciplinary teams are expensive to provide, requiring significant clinician time and health care resources. Their effectiveness varies according to the type of cancer and stage of disease, and their cost-effectiveness has not been clearly established. INCLUSION CRITERIA: Papers reporting on the costs of using multidisciplinary teams for the treatment of patients with cancer (at any age, level of care and in any country) will be included in the review. Costs may include the costs or resources used to provide the multidisciplinary teams (e.g. teleconference equipment, travel-time and clinician-time) or subsequent medical or non-medical costs of care. METHODS: Databases, including PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and the NHS Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED), will be searched from inception. Citations and references of included studies will also be searched. Two reviewers will undertake title and abstract screening, followed by full text screening. Data extraction will be conducted using a customized form. Included studies will be summarized using narrative synthesis structured around intervention characteristics and the type of economic data presented. Additional narrative synthesis will be considered for specific subgroups (depending on numbers and variation).','Reyes Veliz A and Gray J and Karnon J','JBI evidence synthesis',NULL,''),(451,2,'21372272','21372272','Review article: high stakes and high risk: a focused qualitative review of hazards during cardiac surgery.','Cardiac surgery is a high-risk procedure performed by a multidisciplinary team using complex tools and technologies. Efforts to improve cardiac surgery safety have been ongoing for more than a decade, yet the literature provides little guidance regarding best practices for identifying errors and improving patient safety. This focused review of the literature was undertaken as part of the FOCUS initiative (Flawless Operative Cardiovascular Unified Systems), a multifaceted effort supported by the Society of Cardiovascular Anesthesiologists Foundation to identify hazards and develop evidence-based protocols to improve cardiac surgery safety. Hazards were defined as anything that posed a potential or real risk to the patient, including errors, near misses, and adverse events. Of the 1438 articles identified for title review, 390 underwent full abstract screening, and 69 underwent full article review, which in turn yielded 55 meeting the inclusion criteria for this review. Two key themes emerged. First, studies were predominantly reactive (responding to an event or report) instead of proactive (using prospective designs such as self-assessments and external reviewers, etc.) and very few tested interventions. Second, minor events were predictive of major problems: multiple, often minor, deviations from normal procedures caused a cascade effect, resulting in major distractions that ultimately led to major events. This review fills an important gap in the literature on cardiac surgery safety, that of systematically identifying and categorizing known hazards according to their primary systemic contributor (or contributors). We conclude with recommendations for improving patient outcomes by building a culture of safety, promoting transparency, standardizing training, increasing teamwork, and monitoring performance. Finally, there is an urgent need for studies that evaluate interventions to mitigate the inherent risks of cardiac surgery.','Martinez EA and Thompson DA and Errett NA and Kim GR and Bauer L and Lubomski LH and Gurses AP and Marsteller JA and Mohit B and Goeschel CA and Pronovost PJ','Anesthesia and analgesia',NULL,'Animals,Cardiac Surgical Procedures/*adverse effects/mortality/standards,Clinical Competence,Evidence-Based Medicine,Medical Errors/prevention & control,Patient Care Team,Patient Safety,Postoperative Complications/*etiology/mortality/prevention & control,Practice Guidelines as Topic,Quality Indicators, Health Care,Risk Assessment,Risk Factors,Treatment Outcome'),(452,2,'32215957','32215957','Umbrella review of family-focused care interventions supporting families where a family member has a long-term condition.','AIM: The aim of this study was to summarize reviews of family-focused care interventions that support families with a family member with a long-term condition across the life course. DESIGN: Umbrella review. DATA SOURCES: Medline (1946-2019), Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019), Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effect and EMBASE (1947-2019), CINAHL (1981-2019), Health Technology Assessment Database (2019) and PsycInfo (1806-2019). REVIEW METHODS: All authors independently undertook title/abstract screening, data extraction and quality appraisal on a cluster of papers, working in groups of two or three to reach a consensus. The AMSTAR tool was used to appraise the quality of the studies and descriptive syntheses were undertaken. RESULTS: Fifteen reviews met the selection criteria. Overall family-focussed care and associated terms were poorly defined. Typically interventions were educational or psychological therapy/counselling with the goal of empowering individuals to manage their condition. There is some evidence that family-focused care interventions can improve clinical/biological health measures and self-care outcomes such as treatment adherence. Multicomponent psychosocial interventions that include cognitive-behavioural therapy, skills training, education and support and are focused on wider family members appear to improve family relationships and martial functioning. CONCLUSION: Long-term conditions have an impact on individual and family health and well-being, yet the impact of family-focused care interventions on family outcomes was overall inconclusive. A better understanding of how family-focused care interventions improve the health and well-being of individuals and their families is needed to promote the inclusion of family-focused care into practice. IMPACT: Supporting people with a long-term condition is a key health and social care priority. Family-focused care interventions have potential to improve the health and well-being of individuals and families, but there is a need to evaluate their clinical and cost-effectiveness. The findings from this review could be used by funding bodies when commissioning research for long-term conditions.','Smith J and Ali P and Birks Y and Curtis P and Fairbrother H and Kirk S and Saltiel D and Thompson J and Swallow V','Journal of advanced nursing',NULL,'');

The goal of our project was to conduct a case study to explore a screening approach that temporarily replaces a human screener with a semi-automated screening tool. METHODS: We evaluated the accuracy of the approach using DistillerAI as a semi-automated screening tool. A published comparative effectiveness review served as the reference standard. Five teams of professional systematic reviewers screened the same 2472 abstracts in parallel. Each team trained DistillerAI with 300 randomly selected abstracts that the team screened dually. For all remaining abstracts, DistillerAI replaced one human screener and provided predictions about the relevance of records. A single reviewer also screened all remaining abstracts. A second human screener resolved conflicts between the single reviewer and DistillerAI. We compared the decisions of the machine-assisted approach, single-reviewer screening, and screening with DistillerAI alone against the reference standard. RESULTS: The combined sensitivity of the machine-assisted screening approach across the five screening teams was 78% (95% confidence interval [CI], 66 to 90%), and the combined specificity was 95% (95% CI, 92 to 97%). By comparison, the sensitivity of single-reviewer screening was similar (78%; 95% CI, 66 to 89%); however, the sensitivity of DistillerAI alone was substantially worse (14%; 95% CI, 0 to 31%) than that of the machine-assisted screening approach. Specificities for single-reviewer screening and DistillerAI were 94% (95% CI, 91 to 97%) and 98% (95% CI, 97 to 100%), respectively. Machine-assisted screening and single-reviewer screening had similar areas under the curve (0.87 and 0.86, respectively); by contrast, the area under the curve for DistillerAI alone was just slightly better than chance (0.56). The interrater agreement between human screeners and DistillerAI with a prevalence-adjusted kappa was 0.85 (95% CI, 0.84 to 0.86%). CONCLUSIONS: The accuracy of DistillerAI is not yet adequate to replace a human screener temporarily during abstract screening for systematic reviews. Rapid reviews, which do not require detecting the totality of the relevant evidence, may find semi-automation tools to have greater utility than traditional systematic reviews.','Gartlehner G and Wagner G and Lux L and Affengruber L and Dobrescu A and Kaminski-Hartenthaler A and Viswanathan M','Systematic reviews',NULL,'Abstracting and Indexing/classification,Humans,Information Storage and Retrieval/*methods,Internet,*Natural Language Processing,Reproducibility of Results,Sensitivity and Specificity,*Software,Systematic Reviews as Topic'),(454,2,'29714037','29714037','Effectiveness of nonpharmacological interventions to reduce procedural anxiety in children and adolescents undergoing treatment for cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis.','OBJECTIVE: Children and young people (CYP) with cancer undergo painful and distressing procedures. We aimed to systematically review the effectiveness of nonpharmacological interventions to reduce procedural anxiety in CYP. METHODS: Extensive literature searches sought randomised controlled trials that quantified the effect of any nonpharmacological intervention for procedural anxiety in CYP with cancer aged 0 to 25. Study selection involved independent title and abstract screening and full text screening by two reviewers. Anxiety, distress, fear, and pain outcomes were extracted from included studies. Where similar intervention, comparator, and outcomes presented, meta-analysis was performed, producing pooled effect sizes (Cohen\'s d) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). All other data were narratively described. Quality and risk of bias appraisal was performed, based on the Cochrane risk of bias tool. RESULTS: Screening of 11 727 records yielded 56 relevant full texts. There were 15 included studies, eight trialling hypnosis, and seven nonhypnosis interventions. There were large, statistically significant reductions in anxiety and pain for hypnosis, particularly compared with treatment as usual (anxiety: d = 2.30; 95% CI, 1.30-3.30; P < .001; pain: d = 2.16; 95% CI, 1.41-2.92; P < .001). Evidence from nonhypnosis interventions was equivocal, with some promising individual studies. There was high risk of bias across included studies limiting confidence in some positive effects. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence suggests promise for hypnosis interventions to reduce procedural anxiety in CYP undergoing cancer treatment. These results largely emerge from one research group, therefore wider research is required. Promising evidence for individual nonhypnosis interventions must be evaluated through rigorously conducted randomised controlled trials.','Nunns M and Mayhew D and Ford T and Rogers M and Curle C and Logan S and Moore D','Psycho-oncology',NULL,'Adolescent,Anxiety/*therapy,Child,Humans,*Hypnosis,Neoplasms/*therapy,*Outcome Assessment, Health Care,Pain, Procedural/*psychology,*Psychotherapy');
